[[Image:WOODHEYS CATTERY - Southern Cattery.jpg|thumb|right|Woodheys Cattery]]
A '''cattery''' is where [[cat]]s are commercially housed.

Catteries come in two varieties - boarding catteries and breeding catteries.

== Boarding cattery ==
{{globalize/UK|section|date=November 2013}}
[[Image:Rockwell Cattery - geograph.org.uk - 425851.jpg|thumb|right|Rockwell Cattery]]
A boarding cattery is where cats are housed temporarily, when they cannot stay at their owners' home. Boarding catteries (cat boarding kennels) are mostly used by owners who are away on holiday, although they may also be used during house moves, building work or when their owners are incapacitated, for example if they have to go into hospital.

Cats must be adequately looked after, otherwise the owner(s) of the cattery may face legal action by the law or cat protection bodies such as the [[RSPCA]] if the owner(s) of the cat feel that it be necessary.

All establishments boarding cats within the [[United Kingdom]] are required to be licensed and inspected by the [[local authority]]'s [[Environmental Health]] department under the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/43/enacted Animal Boarding Establishments Act 1963.] Licensed establishments will have a copy of their licence prominently displayed as part of their conditions of licence].

A [[veterinary surgeon]] (vet) will not be deemed to keep a boarding establishment for cats so long as the cat is at the time receiving treatment by the veterinary surgeon and the boarding is a requirement of the treatment. 
 
A vet will be deemed to be keeping a boarding establishment if, at the time of boarding, the cat is not under treatment or required to board as part of that treatment. If the boarding facility is advertised as ancillary to the vet's main business, the establishment will need to be licensed and inspected by their [[local authority]] and meet the conditions as per any other boarding establishment.

In determining whether to grant a licence for the keeping of a boarding establishment for animals by any person at any premises, a local authority shall in particular pay regard to the following:

# that cats will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable as respects construction, size of quarters, number of occupants, exercising facilities, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness
# that cats will be adequately supplied with suitable food, drink and bedding material, adequately exercised / stimulated, and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals
# that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent and control the spread among cats of infectious or contagious diseases, including the provision of adequate isolation facilities
# that appropriate steps will be taken for the protection of the cats in case of fire or other emergency
# that a register - either hard or soft copy - be kept, containing a description of any cats received into the establishment, date of arrival and departure, and the name and address of the owner; such register is to be available for inspection at all times by an officer of the local authority, vet or veterinary practitioner authorised by the local authority.

International Cat Care (ICC), a long-established cat charity in the United Kingdom, has defined standards for the construction and management of boarding catteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starting a boarding cattery|url=http://icatcare.org/advice/catteries/starting-boarding-cattery|website=International Cat Care|publisher=International Cat Care|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICC standards are in addition to those set by local councils for licensing purposes.

== Breeding cattery ==
A breeding cattery is where cats are [[Animal husbandry|bred]]. Cats may be bred as a hobby, or on a commercial basis where they are sold for profit.

In the United States, there are two main cat registries - the [[Cat Fanciers Association]]  (CFA) and [[The International Cat Association]] (TICA) which establish standards for member breeders. These cat registries also award certificates for catteries that have been inspected for healthy environments.  Additionally, many U.S. States and municipalities, along with the Federal government, provide some regulations of breeding catteries.

In Europe the standards are established by the [[Fédération Internationale Féline]] (FIFe) or [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF). In Italy by the [[Associazione Nazionale Felina Italiana]] (ANFI).

The '''KattenKabinet''' (&quot;Cat Cabinet&quot;) is an art museum in [[Amsterdam]] devoted to works depicting [[cat]]s. The museum collection includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and other works of art by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]], [[Sal Meijer]], [[Théophile Steinlen]], and [[Jože Ciuha]], among others.

The museum is housed in a canalside building at [[Herengracht]] 497, in the grand ''[[Gouden Bocht]]'' (&quot;Golden Bend&quot;) of this canal. The owner lives on the second floor of the building with his family. There are some cats in the museum as well.

== History == 
The house and the adjacent building at Herengracht 499 were built in 1667 for the patrician brothers Willem and Adriaen van Loon. Through the luck of the draw, Willem was given the house at number 497. Later, the house was inhabited by Amsterdam mayor [[Jan Calkoen]] and Amsterdam pensionary [[Engelbert François van Berckel]], among others. [[John Adams]] visited Van Berckel at the house during his time as U.S. ambassador to the Dutch republic.

In 1985, the building was restored, and in 1990 the museum was founded by Bob Meijer in memory of his red tomcat John Pierpont Morgan (named after the American banker [[J. P. Morgan]]).

The museum served as filming location for ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Twelve - Production notes - About the production|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2807|publisher=CinemaReview.com|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">'''Ailurophobia''' is a type of [[specific phobia]]: the persistent, irrational fear of [[cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Louis S. |last=London |title= Cataphobia  and ornithophobia |journal=Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=365–371 |year=1952 |pmid=14949213 |doi=10.1007/BF01568473 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|αἴλουρος}} (''ailouros''), &quot;cat&quot; and {{lang|el|φόβος}} (''phóbos''), &quot;fear&quot;. Other names include felinophobia,&lt;ref name=&quot;responsibility1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A lexicon of lunacy: metaphoric malady, moral responsibility, and psychiatry|first=Thomas|last=Szasz|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; elurophobia,&lt;ref name=&quot;responsibility1&quot;/&gt; and cat phobia.&lt;ref name=&quot;responsibility1&quot;/&gt;

==Description==
The phobia manifests itself in different ways. For most people it is less about fear than about loathing, similar to the reaction many people have to snakes or rats. Some people  experience it almost all the time, others just in response to direct stimuli. Some possible situations that can trigger the loathing of cats are: hearing purring, seeing a cat in real life, imagining the possibility of a cat touching or rubbing against one, the thought of meeting a cat in the dark, seeing the staring eyes of a cat (cats have the tendency to stare at passers-by) cats in pictures and on television, and cat-like toys and cat-like fur. [[Big cats]] such as [[lions]] or [[tigers]] can also trigger the stimuli associated with a phobia.&lt;ref name=freeman1960&gt;{{Cite journal|first=H. L. |last=Freeman |author2=D. C. Kendrick |title=A case of cat phobia. Treatment by a method derived from experimental psychology |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=2 |issue=5197 |pages=497–502 |date=August 1960 |pmid=13824737 |pmc=2097085 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.824.497|url= |accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There are many ways to treat ailurophobia; treatment is usually carried out by a psychiatrist or other therapy specialist.

One strongly motivated patient was able to recover by slowly becoming accustomed to cat fur by first touching varying types of velvet, then becoming accustomed to a toy kitten, and finally a live kitten which the patient subsequently adopted.&lt;ref name=freeman1960/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the 1965 animated television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]],'' the character [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] lists a number of phobias to [[Charlie Brown]] and incorrectly states, &quot;If you’re afraid of cats, you have ailurophasia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ashleyriver.ccsdschools.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_2888189/File/Staff%20Documents/K.%20W.%20Brown/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas.pdf|title=A Charlie Brown Christmas|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=|website=Ashley River Creative Arts Elementary School|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1988 anime ''[[City Hunter|City Hunter 2]]'', despite his herculean physique, it was revealed that Umibozu has a fear of cats. In the 1989 anime ''[[Ranma 1/2]]'' the character principal [[Ranma Saotome]] has fear of cats.

In the 2016 anime ''[[High School Fleet]]'' the character Mashiro Munetani has a fear of cats. In the 2017 anime ''[[Nyanko Days]],'' the character Arashi Iketani has a fear of cats.

The title character in ''[[Big Nate]]'' suffers from ailurophobia. [[Robbie Jackson]], played by [[Dean Gaffney]], in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' also suffers from this.

'''Toe tufts''' are commonly found on [[cat]]s with medium to long coats. Clumps of fur that stick out at least 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm beyond the paw pad can be considered tufts. In addition to soft [[paw]] pads, toe tufts help a cat to silently stalk its prey by muffling excess noise. However, outdoor cats tend to lose their toe tufts due to excessive abrasion on the rougher outdoor surfaces.  This is in distinct contrast to indoor cats who spend most of their time walking on carpet or smooth floors.

Although toe tufts do not cause additional [[hairball]]s in cats, it does make some aspects of hygiene a bit more difficult. For example, cat litter, dirt and other particulates may stick to toe tufts and cause the cat some discomfort. Therefore, a cat with extra long toe tufts should be checked regularly for tangles and taken in for [[Personal grooming|grooming]].

'''Cat training''' is the process of modifying a domestic [[cat]]'s behavior for entertainment or companionship purposes. Training is commonly used to reduce unwanted or problematic behaviors in domestic cats, to enhance interactions between humans and pet cats, and to allow them to coexist comfortably. There are various methods for training cats which employ different balances between reward and punishment.

==House training==

===Litter box training===

Cats may be easily trained to use a [[kitty litter]] box or tray, as this is natural behavior. Many cats and kittens will instinctively use a litter box without needing to be taught, because of their instincts to expel bodily waste in dirt or sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Litter Box Training for Your Kitten|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2137&amp;aid=3288|website=Peteducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, with a new kitten, owners usually need to simply show the kitten where the litter box is located, and how to get in and out. On occasion, some training is required to help a new cat adjust to a litter box, or to help an older cat that suddenly stops using the litter box.

Cats may also be trained to use a human [[toilet]].&lt;ref name=UTYC4&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iut5j1Yf0IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA52,M1|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat Or Kitten|author=H. Ellen Whiteley|year=2006|isbn=978-0-86534-509-6|chapter=ch.4 Etiquette Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of this method are that cat owners can eliminate the task of maintaining a clean litter box on a regular basis and avoid the smell that results when a litter box is not cleaned often enough. Some cat behaviorists advise against toilet training because it restricts the owner from monitoring changes in the cat's urine and feces (which are often related to the health of the pet). Another criticism is that toilet training can cause various stresses to the cat, partly because using the toilet goes against a cat's natural instinct to dig and cover its own feces, and because the toilet seat can be physically difficult for cats to straddle (especially those who are old or ill).&lt;ref name=Toilet-CBA&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Toilet Training Your Cat a Good Idea?|url=http://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/toilet-training/|website=Catbehaviorassociates.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training methods==

===Positive reinforcement===

Cats are known for their [[independence]] and self-interest. They will resist training by [[punishment]], reacting with [[fear]] and stress rather than [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]].&lt;ref name=Training-ASPCA/&gt; The result of failure to instill obedience may be that the human unintentionally reinforces undesired behavior, like loud meowing or complaining for attention.&lt;ref name=UTYC&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iut5j1Yf0IC|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat Or Kitten|author=H. Ellen Whiteley|year=2006|isbn=978-0-86534-509-6|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, most trainers encourage cat owners to use [[positive reinforcement]] training only, rewarding the cat for desired or &quot;good&quot; behavior, and offering her alternative options or distractions (instead of punishment) for undesired behavior.&lt;ref name=Training-ASPCA/&gt; Training a cat involves motivation, cooperation, time, and patience from the human.&lt;ref name=Righetti/&gt;

===Clicker training===

[[Clicker training]] was developed by Keller Breland, Marian Breland Bailey, and Bob Bailey.&lt;ref name=KarenPryor&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pryor|first1=Karen|title=Clicker Training: A Grass Roots Revolution in Behavioral Technology|url=http://www.clickertraining.com/node/153|website=Clickertraining.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was initially used in the training of marine mammals, and later spread into the world of pet training (mainly dogs and cats, but it has been used with other animals as well). Clicker training uses a sound to signal to the animal that he/she has performed the correct, or desired, behavior.&lt;ref name=Clicker-ASPCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Clicker Training Your Pet|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/clicker-training-your-pet|website=ASPCA.org|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trainers can utilize any item that makes a sound (e.g., a whistle, a beep, or a pen that clicks). Many people use a training tool called a [[clicker]], a little plastic box with a metal tab that, when pressed quickly, makes the click sound.&lt;ref name=Clicker-ASPCA/&gt; When clicker training a cat, the trainer clicks at the exact moment that the cat does the desired behavior and rewards with a treat immediately after the click. The cat will begin to associate the sound with the treat, and understand that the sound means she has done the right thing. Clicker training is popular in the cat training field because the clicker (or other sound) allows a trainer to tell the cat immediately when she has performed correctly, and makes it easier for the cat to identify exactly which action/behavior she is being rewarded for.&lt;ref name=Training-ASPCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Your Cat|url=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior/training-your-cat|website=ASPCA.org|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem behaviors==
A veterinarian can rule out possible medical causes for behavioral issues in cats.&lt;ref name=Schelling&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schelling|first1=Christianne|title=Training your cat|url=http://www.cattraining.com/cat-train-basics.htm|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If medical causes are ruled out, cat behaviorists can help address problematic behaviors by retraining the cat and humans so that the cat's needs are met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kluv.cbslocal.com/2014/05/20/jackson-galaxy-the-show-sould-be-called-my-people-from-hell/ &quot;Jackson Galaxy: The Show Should Be Called 'My People From Hell'&quot;], 98.7 KLUV, May 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scratching===

Many cats scratch furniture like chairs and couches (even when scratching posts are provided for them in the home) because a cat's instinct is to scratch various objects, like trees, as a marker for other cats to see and smell.&lt;ref name=Yin-scratching /&gt; Trainers suggest guiding cats toward designated scratching objects that they will enjoy, changing the style or location of scratching posts around the house, and making scratching the furniture inconvenient.&lt;ref name=Yin-scratching&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Sophia|title=June is Adopt a Cat Month: Training Your New Cat to Stop Scratching Furniture|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/june-is-adopt-a-cat-month-training-your-new-cat-not-to-scratch-furniture|website=drsophiayin.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some use positive reinforcement training, often accompanied by a clicker, to engage the cat in using the scratching post.

===Spraying===

[[Urine spraying]] is a problem usually found with intact male cats, but can also occur with females and [[neutering|neutered]] cats. Solutions for this issue include: keeping the litter box extremely clean, removing causes of stress from the cat's environment, providing separate food and litter boxes in a multiple cat household, and preventing outdoor cats from accessing the yard and area around the house. In cases where spraying persists, owners are recommended to seek veterinary help as this could be due to anxiety or physical health issues.&lt;ref name=Yin-spraying&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Sophia|title=Tips for Dealing with Urine Spraying in Cats|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/tips-for-dealing-with-urine-spraying-in-cats|website=drsophiayin.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meowing===

Cats [[cat communication|meow]] for various reasons, and some are naturally more vocal than others. This becomes a problem behavior when there is excessive meowing or yowling, especially at night. Positive reinforcement training, sometimes accompanied by a clicker, is commonly used in this case. This involves ignoring the cat when she is making noise, and rewarding with treats and affection when she is being quiet.&lt;ref name=Yin-meowing&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Sophia|title=Training a Cat to Be Quiet: My Cat Meows Too Much, What Do I Do?|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/training-a-cat-to-be-quiet-my-cat-meows-too-much-what-do-i-do|website=drsophiayin.com|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tricks==
A cat may be trained to do tricks such as playing dead or ringing the doorbell.&lt;ref name=UTYC7&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iut5j1Yf0IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA120,M1|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat Or Kitten|author=H. Ellen Whiteley|year=2006|isbn=978-0-86534-509-6|chapter=ch.7 Teaching}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the cat's flexibility and bone structure, they are able to twist and bend their bodies, and jump a fair distance from standing still.&lt;ref name=Johnson-Bennet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson-Bennett|first1=Pam|title=Think Like a Cat: How to Raise a Well-Adjusted Cat-- Not a Sour Puss|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; This talent can be turned into tricks involving jumping through hoops and off scratching posts.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norman|first1=Anne|title=All About Cat Training|date=2014|publisher=Bookpubber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are able to learn many types of commands,&lt;ref name=Righetti&gt;{{cite web|last1=Righetti|first1=Joanne|title=Cat training, it's easier than you think|url=http://www.purina.com.au/cats/training/train|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as to come when called, sit, roll over, shake a paw, and jump.&lt;ref name=Righetti/&gt;

[[File:Ryo-ohki.jpg|thumb|The cabbit [[Ryo-Ohki]] from the [[Tenchi Muyo]] anime series]]
A '''cabbit''' is a fictional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a [[cat]] and a [[rabbit]].  They have appeared in fiction and fantasy stories including [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] and [[manga]], and have also been dubiously purported to have been observed in the wild.  Most if not all observations are attributable to either misidentified [[Manx cat]]s or outright hoaxes.

A cat-rabbit hybrid creature was first incorrectly documented by [[Joseph Train]] of Castle Douglas, Galloway, Scotland, in his &quot;An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man&quot;, where he opined that the local Manx cat was such a hybrid: &quot;My observations on the structure and habits of the specimen in my possession, leave little doubt on my mind of its being a ''mule'', or cross between the female cat and the buck rabbit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Train&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Train|1845}}, volume 1, p.21n; By ''mule'', Train means only figuratively of course, he's not suggesting the manx is a cross between horse and ass&lt;/ref&gt; Train also refers to the tufty tail on the posterior of the &quot;Manks&quot; cat as being a ''fud'' ({{lang-sco|[[wiktionary:fud#Scots|fud]]}}), &quot;or brush like that of a rabbit.&quot; Scientific study has determined that such a hybrid is genetically impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;cantbreed&quot;&gt;Sarah Hartwell.  [http://www.messybeast.com/cabbit3.htm &quot;Cabbits - Why Cats Can't Breed With Rabbits&quot;].  2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[portmanteau]] term &quot;cabbit&quot; is used for such imagined hybrids.  The exact year of coinage is uncertain.  The term was used in 1977 to describe a specimen found in New Mexico and exhibited in Los Angeles.  The specimen was showcased on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]] and was later determined to be a cat with a deformed pelvis.&lt;ref name=&quot;messybeast&quot;&gt;[http://www.messybeast.com/cabbit.htm Cabbits - What Are They]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cat mutations==
[[Manx cat]]s and other cats with tailless or bobtailed mutations account for many alleged cabbit sightings.  The mutation that causes taillessness can also cause skeletal and/or nerve abnormalities that result in the cat's using a hopping motion.  This was once accepted by breeders as a feature of the Manx's look, but is now considered a serious fault in the show-ring and does not form part of the modern Manx standard of points.  Modern breeders of the Manx are careful to breed only from cats that have normal locomotion.  The relatively long hind legs of the Manx, combined with taillessness or a very short tail, give the impression of a rabbit.

In 1947, Grace Cox-Ife wrote: &quot;There are several points about a Manx that make it anything but ordinary. The chief one is, of course, its taillessness; but this is not quite the whole story. Not only must a Manx have no tail but it should really be a further joint or more short on the spinal column; that is to say there should be a hollow where the tail would normally begin. Then there is the gait &amp;ndash; a rabbity hop rather than a walk- which is caused by the height of the hindquarters: according to the Manx Cat Club these &quot;cannot be too high, and the back cannot be too short, while there must be great depth of flank. The head should be round and large, but not of the snubby or Persian type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox-Ife&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Cox-Ife |first=Grace |title=Questions Answered About Cats |year=1948 |publisher=Jordan &amp; Sons |location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose Tenent wrote: &quot;No cat is more fascinating than the tailless Manx, with its rabbit-like hoppity gait [...] . The hind legs are considerably longer than the front ones, thus giving the cat its peculiar hopping gait; incidentally, also the reason for the reasonable theory held in some quarters that the Manx cat is the result of a cross-mating between a cat and a rabbit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenent&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tenent |first=Rose |title=Pedigree Cats |year=1955 |publisher=Crosby Lockwood &amp; Sons |location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the flap of loose skin from the belly to the haunches is absent, enhancing the visual similarity to a rabbit.

Cats with radial [[hypoplasia]] (abnormal short forelegs) may also adopt a rabbit-like gait.

A '''cat lady''' is a cultural archetype or a [[stock character]], often depicted as a single woman, a middle-aged or elderly [[spinster]], who owns many pet [[cat]]s. The term can be considered [[pejorative]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/14/crazy-cat-lady-pets-stereotype-forbes-woman-time-felines.html |title= Crazy Cat Ladies |author=Kiri Blakeley |date=15 Oct 2009 |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is sometimes embraced.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesunion.com&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/mydogbandit/do-you-believe-in-the-crazy-cat-lady/2080/ |title= Do you believe in the Crazy Cat Lady? |author=Mark Ramirez |date=5 Aug 2009 |work=timesunion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and association ==
Women who have cats have long been associated with the concept of [[spinster]]hood. In more recent decades, the concept of a cat lady has been associated with &quot;romance-challenged (often career-oriented) women&quot;.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;

A cat lady may also be an [[Animal hoarding|animal hoarder]] who keeps large numbers of cats without having the ability to properly house or care for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Davis| first = Susan| author-link = | last2 = Flaherty (illus)| first2 = Jake| author2-link = | title = Prosecuting Animal Hoarders is like Herding Cats| journal = California Lawyer| volume = | issue = September| pages = 26, 28, 29, 67| date = | year = 2002| url = http://www.tufts.edu/vet/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf| accessdate = June 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be ignorant about their situation, or generally unaware of their situation. People who are aware of it are not normally considered cat ladies.

Some writers, celebrities, and artists have challenged the  gender-based &quot;Crazy Cat Lady&quot; stereotype, and embraced the term to mean an animal lover or rescuer who cares for one or multiple cats, and who is psychologically healthy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/beth-ostrosky-stern-crazy-cat-lady-article-1.2361539 Beth Ostronsky Stern: I Am A Crazy Cat Lady, New York Daily News, September 15, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/its-time-to-smash-the-crazy-cat-lady-stereotype Moss, Laura, It's Time to Smash the Crazy Cat Lady Stereotype, Mother Nature Network, November 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/photos/meet-men-proud-crazy-cat-ladies-29245631/image-29246901 Williams, David, Meet The Men Proud to Be Crazy Cat Ladies, ABC News, Retrieved November 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary ==
The documentary ''Cat Ladies'' (2009) tells the stories of four women whose lives became dedicated to their cats. The film was directed by Christie Callan-Jones and produced by Chocolate Box Entertainment, originally for [[TVOntario]]. It was an official selection at the 2009 Hot Docs Festival, Silverdocs Festival, and San Francisco's DocFest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catladiesdoc.com/|title=Cat Ladies – the Documentary|author=Jeannette Loakman|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1447950|Cat Ladies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naftali Berrill, Ph.D., Director of the New York Center for Neuropsychology and Forensic Behavioral Science told [[AOL]] Health, &quot;These may be people who have a very hard time expressing themselves to other people. They may find the human need for affection is met most easily through a relationship with a pet.&quot; This devotion can sometimes signal mental or emotional issues such as depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;huso&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Huso |first=Deborah |authorlink= |title=Some Live Among Hundreds of Cats |publisher=AOL Health |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/mental-health/cat-lady |accessdate=November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119071209/http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/mental-health/cat-lady |archivedate=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Toxoplasma gondii'' ==
Recent research indicates a link between the parasite ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which sexually reproduces exclusively in cats, and causes numerous psychiatric conditions, including [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/03/how-your-cat-is-making-you-crazy/308873/ |title=How Your Cat Is Making You Crazy – Kathleen McAuliffe |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[compulsive hoarding]] of cats, a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), has long been associated with &quot;crazy cat ladies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-more-isnt-enough/201106/animal-hoarding-is-there-such-thing-the-crazy-cat-lady|title=When More Isn't Enough|author= D.J. Moran and Jennifer L. Patterson|publisher= Psychology Today|date=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media has drawn on this stereotype to coin the term ''Crazy Cat Lady Syndrome'' to refer to the association between ''T. gondii'' and psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Atlantic&quot; /&gt;

== Notable examples ==
* [[Florence Nightingale]] had many cats named after famous public figures such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainmentreview.donkrax.com/celebrity-cat-lovers.html Celebrity cat lovers]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edith Ewing Bouvier]] and her daughter [[Edith Bouvier Beale]] had many cats living with them in their decrepit home [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens]]. Reportedly, some 30 cats lived in the house by the time [[Little Edie]] sold it in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmagazine.com/w/blogs/editorsblog/2009/04/08/sally-quinn.html Sally Quinn on life in Grey Gardens], ''[[W magazine]]'', April 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bertha Rand was Winnipeg's notorious Cat Lady, who for years battled her neighbours and city hall to save her dozens of cats. Even years after her death, she still holds a place in Canadian popular culture. [[Maureen Hunter]]'s play ''The Queen of Queen Street'' is based on Rand's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signature-editions.com/index.php/books/single_title/the_queen_of_queen_street|title=Signature Editions|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural references ==
Cat ladies in popular culture include:

=== Television ===

[[File:Kitten in Rizal Park, Manila.jpg|thumb|230px|A stray kitten in [[Rizal Park]], [[Manila]] ]]
A '''kitten''', also known as a '''kitty''' or '''kitty cat''', is a [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] [[cat]]. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and enjoy human companionship.

==Etymology and development==
The word &quot;kitten&quot; derives from the [[Middle English]] word ''kitoun'', which in turn came from the [[Old French]] ''chitoun'' or ''cheton''.{{sfn|Oxford Dictionary 2005}} Juvenile [[big cat]]s are called &quot;cubs&quot; rather than kittens; either term may be used for the young of smaller wild [[felidae|felids]], such as [[ocelot]]s, [[caracal]]s and [[lynx]], but &quot;kitten&quot; is usually more common for these species.{{sfn|Sunquist|Sunquist|2014|pp=58–59}}

[[File:Laitche-P013.jpg|thumb|left|A litter of kittens being suckled by their mother]]
[[File:Youngkitten.JPG|thumb|left|A kitten opens its eyes for the first time]]
[[File:Aggressive Mother Cat.jpg|thumb|left|A mother cat protecting her kittens at [[Chinawal]], India]]
A feline [[Litter (animal)|litter]] usually consists of two to five kittens{{sfn|Tsutsui|Stabenfeldt|1993|p=1699}} born after a [[gestation]] lasting between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days.{{sfn|Tsutsui|Stabenfeldt|1993|p=1699}} Kittens emerge in a sac called the [[amnion]], which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.{{sfn|Vandivert|1975|p=53}}

For the first several weeks, kittens are unable to [[urinate]] or [[defecate]] without being stimulated by their mother.{{sfn|Pet Education 2011}} They are also unable to regulate their body temperature for the first three weeks, so kittens born in temperatures less than {{convert|27|C|F}} can die from [[hypothermia]] if their mother does not keep them warm.{{sfn|International Cat Care 2015}} The mother's milk is very important for the kittens' nutrition and proper growth. This milk transfers [[antibody|antibodies]] to the kittens, which helps protect them against [[infectious disease]].{{sfn|Casal|Jezyk|Giger|1996|p=1653}} Newborn kittens are unable to produce concentrated [[urine]], and so have a very high requirement for fluids.{{sfn|Sturgess|Hurley|2005|p=243}} Kittens open their eyes about seven to ten days after birth. At first, the [[retina]] is poorly developed and vision is poor. Kittens are not able to see as well as adult cats until about ten weeks after birth.{{sfn|Tootle|Friedlander|1989|p=1325}}

Kittens develop very quickly from about two weeks of age until their seventh week. Their coordination and strength improve. They [[play (activity)|play]]-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens' mother or other adult cats, who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the adult cats demonstrate hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate.{{sfn|Poirier|Hussey|1982|pp=133–148}} As they reach three to four weeks old, the kittens are gradually [[weaning|weaned]] and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks.{{sfn|Sturgess|Hurley|2005|p=244}} Kittens generally begin to lose their [[deciduous teeth|baby teeth]] around three months of age, and have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months.{{sfn|Veterinary Medicine 2013}} Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers. Some mother cats will scatter their kittens as early as three months of age, while others continue to look after them until they approach [[sexual maturity]].{{sfn|Bönisch|1996|pp=23–24}}

The sex of kittens is usually easy to determine at birth. By six to eight weeks they are harder to sex because of the growth of fur in the genital region. The male's [[urinary meatus|urethral opening]] is round, whereas the female's urethral opening is a slit. Another marked difference is the distance between [[anus]] and urethral opening, which is greater in males than in females.{{sfn|Walls|1991|p=22}}

Kittens are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with available animals and playing on their own. Play with other kittens peaks in the third or fourth month after birth, with more solitary hunting and stalking play peaking later, at about five months.{{sfn|Crowell-Davis|2005|p=18}} 

Kittens are vulnerable because they like to find dark places to hide, sometimes with fatal results if they are not watched carefully.&lt;ref&gt;Cats have a habit of seeking refuge under or inside cars or on top of car tires during stormy or cold weather. This often leads to broken bones, burns, heat stroke, damaged internal organs or death. Daphne Sashin, [http://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/risky-hiding-places-for-cats Five Risky Hiding Places For Cats]. WebMD, September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although domestic kittens are commonly sent to new homes at six to eight weeks of age, it has been suggested that being with their mother and litter-mates from six to twelve weeks is important for a kitten's social and behavioural development.{{sfn|Crowell-Davis|2005|p=18}} Usually, breeders and foster/rescue homes will not sell or adopt out a kitten that is younger than twelve weeks. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to give away kittens younger than eight weeks of age.{{sfn|Sunquist|Sunquist|2014|p=111}} Kittens generally reach sexual maturity at around seven months old. A cat reaches full &quot;adulthood&quot; around one year of age.{{sfn|Santa Maria Times 2013}}

==Health==
Domestic kittens in developed societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses from two to three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against [[feline viral rhinotracheitis]] (FVR), [[feline calicivirus]] (C), and [[feline panleukopenia]] (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against [[rabies]] may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually [[spaying and neutering|spayed or neutered]] at seven months of age, but kittens may be neutered as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in [[animal shelter]]s.{{sfn|Olson|Kustritz|Johnston|2001|pp=223–232}} Such early neutering does not appear to have any [[Spaying and neutering#Disadvantages|long-term health risks to cats]], and may even be beneficial in male cats.{{sfn|Spain|Scarlett|Houpt|2004|pp=372–379}} Kittens are commonly wormed against [[roundworm]]s from about four weeks.{{sfn|McHattie|1993|p=121}}

==Orphaned kittens==
[[File:Black Cat Nala.jpg|thumb|right|A young orphaned [[black cat|black kitten]] in [[Los Angeles]], showing signs of [[malnourishment]]]]
Kittens require a high-calorie diet that contains more protein than the diet of adult cats.{{sfn|Rogers|Morris|1979|pp=718–723}} Young orphaned kittens require cat milk every two to four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate.{{sfn|Pet Education 2011}} Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because [[Dairy cattle|cow]]'s milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients.{{sfn|Guilford|1994|pp=2663–2669}} Human-reared kittens tend to be very affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression.{{sfn|Heath|2005|p=102}} Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.{{sfn|Messonnier|2010|p=375}}

'''Felinology''' is the [[Research|study]] of [[cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;As noted in the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine [http://www.vfs.unsa.ba/ba_docs/desavanja/workshop_bologna_2007/7a_Beograd.ppt Curriculum]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is of [[Latin]]-[[Greek language|Greek]] origin and comes from the Latin word ''{{lang|la|felinus}}'' (of cats, feline) and the Greek ''{{lang|grc|-logos}}'' (science). Felinology is concerned with studying the [[anatomy]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], and [[animal husbandry|breeding]] of domestic and wild cats.

Fel d 1, produced largely in [[cat]] [[saliva]] and [[sebaceous gland]]s, is the primary [[allergen]] present on cats and kittens.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12851385&quot; /&gt; Fel d 1 is also produced by cat skin itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DABROWSKI|first1=A|last2=VANDERBREMPT|first2=X|last3=SOLER|first3=M|last4=SEGURET|first4=N|last5=LUCCIANI|first5=P|last6=CHARPIN|first6=D|last7=VERVLOET|first7=D|title=Cat skin as an important source of Fel d I allergen|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=86|issue=4|pages=462–465|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(05)80200-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein is of an unknown function to the animal but causes an [[IgG]] or [[IgE]] reaction in sensitive humans (either as an allergic or asthmatic response). Removal of soft surfaces in the home (carpet, furniture), frequent washings of bed linens, [[HEPA]] filters and even washing cats has been proven to reduce the amounts of Fel d 1 present in the home.

Female cats produce a lower level of Fel d 1 than males, and neutered males produce a lower level of Fel d 1 than unneutered males.&lt;ref&gt;Sex difference in Fel d 1 allergen production. http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(96)70238-5/fulltext . Accessed 31 Oct 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neutered males produce Fel d 1 in levels similar to females (both intact and spayed females produce Fel d 1 in similar levels). Even though females and neutered males produce Fel d 1 in lower levels, they still produce enough to cause [[Allergy#Signs and symptoms|allergic symptoms]] in sensitive individuals.

==Structure==

The complete [[quaternary structure]] of Fel d 1 has been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12851385&quot; /&gt; The allergen is a [[tetrameric protein|tetrameric]] [[glycoprotein]] consisting of two [[disulfide]]-linked [[heterodimer]]s of chains 1 and 2. Fel d 1 chains 1 and 2 share [[secondary structure|structural]] similarity with [[uteroglobin]], a [[secretoglobin]] [[Protein family|superfamily]] member; chain 2 is a glycoprotein with N-linked [[oligosaccharide]]s. Both chains share an all alpha-helical structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12851385&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6709">'''Cat burning''' was a form of [[Zoosadism|zoosadistic]] entertainment in [[France]] prior to the 1800s. In this form of entertainment, people would gather dozens of [[cat]]s in a net and hoist them high into the air from a special bundle onto a [[bonfire]]. In the [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods, cats, which were associated with [[vanity]] and [[witchcraft]], were sometimes burned as symbols of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Benton | first= Janetta Rebold | authorlink= | coauthors= | title= Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings | publisher= Abbeville Press | date= 1 April 1997 | location= | pages= 82 | url= | doi= | id= | isbn= 978-0-7892-0182-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people &quot;shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: a History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-198-20171-0|pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Frazer]] wrote: &quot;It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''The Golden Bough'', (1922). [http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cat-burning was also described in ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]'', a scholarly work by American historian [[Robert Darnton]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cats also figured in the cycle of Saint John the Baptist, which took place on June 24, at the time of summer solstice. Crowds made bonfires, jumped over them, danced around them, and threw into them objects with magical power, hoping to avoid disaster and obtain good fortune during the rest of the year. A favorite object was cats—cats tied up in bags, cats suspended from ropes, or cats burned at stake. Parisians liked to incinerate cats by the sackful, while the Courimauds (or &quot;cour à miaud&quot; or cat chasers) of Saint Chamond preferred to chase a flaming cat through the streets. In parts of Burgundy and Lorraine they danced around a kind of burning May pole with a cat tied to it. In the Metz region they burned a dozen cats at a time in a basket on top of a bonfire. The ceremony took place with great pomp in Metz itself, until it was abolished in 1765. ...&amp;nbsp;Although the practice varied from place to place, the ingredients were everywhere the same: a &quot;feu de joie&quot; (bonfire), cats, and an aura of hilarious witch-hunting. Wherever the scent of burning felines could be found, a smile was sure to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cat Massacre&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=|isbn=0-465-01274-4|pages=83–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-taE3FLTlMC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=cat+burning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fEqQT4TBIa-p0AGNnqmwBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20burning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cat-burning was the subject of a 1758 text from the Benedictine Dom Jean François, ''Dissertation sur l’ancien usage des feux de la Saint-Jean, et d’y brûler les chats à Metz'', recently published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dissertation&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangin|first=Marie-Claire|title=Dissertation sur l’ancien usage des feux de la Saint-Jean, et d’y brûler les chats à Metz, un inédit de dom Jean François|publisher=Cahiers Élie Fleur|year=1995|pages=49–72|url=http://www.sudoc.fr/114652155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Meslier]], a French Catholic priest who privately held atheist views, briefly mentioned the practice of cat burning in his ''Testament'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Among other things, these mischievous, brutal madmen make [the cats] cruelly suffer harsh and violent tortures in their entertainments and even in public celebrations; they tie up nipping cats to the end of some pole they set up and at the bottom of which they light the fires of joy where they burn them alive to have the pleasure of seeing the violent movements and hearing the frightening cries that these poor unfortunate beasts are forced to make because of the harshness and violence of the tortures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meslier&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Meslier|first=Jean|title=Testament: Memoir of the thoughts and sentiments of Jean Meslier|year=2009|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-59102-749-2|pages=562–563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meslier largely attributed these customs to [[Cartesianism|Cartesian philosophy]], wherein non-human animals were viewed as possessing no soul, and thus, no sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemerling|first=Garth|title=Descartes: A New Approach|url=http://www.wisdomworld.org/additional/ExtensionsOfEvidence-Series/DescartesAndTheSoul.html|work=Philosophy Pages|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that this &quot;tends to stifle in the heart of man all feelings of gentleness, kindness, and compassion that they may have for beasts&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meslier&quot; /&gt;

Hundreds of millions of [[cat]]s are kept as [[pet]]s around the world. Cats have either a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[commensalism|commensal]] relationship with humans. Cats are also used in the fur trade, as food, and to control pests.

Cats and humans evolutionarily diverged from a common ancestor ([[boreoeutherian ancestor]]) approximately 80 million years ago, accumulating only 10–12 [[chromosomal translocation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anatoly Ruvinsky |author2=Jennifer A. Marshall Graves |title =Mammalian Genomics | publisher =CABI| year =2005| page = 365| isbn =0851990754}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of several [[gene]]s in chromosomes [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]] in cats closely resembles that in humans.&lt;!-- already referenced below --&gt;

It has long been common for cats to be eaten in some parts of China and in some other Asian countries and it is estimated that in southern China's [[Guangdong]] province people eat 10,000 cats per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28292558/ |title=China Protesters: Stop 'Cooking Cats Alive' – Fury After Newspaper Says 10,000 Felines Are Eaten Daily in Single Province |work=MSNBC|agency=Associated Press|date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal People]] estimates that 4&amp;nbsp;million cats are killed and consumed in Asia every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/03/9/dogs.catseatenAsia903.html |first=Merritt |last=Clifton |author2=Bartlett, Kim |title=How Many Dogs and Cats Are Eaten in Asia? |work=AnimalPeopleNews.org |date=September 2003 |publisher=Animal People, Inc. |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062225/http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/03/9/dogs.catseatenAsia903.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animal-rights group collected 16,000 signatures in 2014 to outlaw the consumption of cat meat in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cat and dog meat off the menu in Switzerland? |date= 26 November 2014 |url= http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30216659 |website= www.bbc.com |access-date= 2016-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pest control==
Cats are also used as a form of pest control, particularly in the case of rat or mouse infestation.&lt;ref&gt;''Clones, Cats, And Chemicals: Thinking Scientifically About Controversial Issues''. p. 9. Irwin L. Slesnick (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pests of Crops in Warmer Climates and Their Control''. p. 120. Dennis S. Hill (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domesticated varieties ==
The current [[list of cat breeds]] is quite large: with the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] recognizing 41 breeds, of which 16 are &quot;natural breeds&quot; that probably emerged before humans began breeding pedigree cats, while the others were developed over the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Lipinski&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.10.009 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=12–21 |title=The ascent of cat breeds: Genetic evaluations of breeds and worldwide random-bred populations |journal=Genomics |date=January 2008 |pmid=18060738 |pmc=2267438 |last1=Lipinski |first1=Monika J. |last2=Froenicke |first2=Lutz |last3=Baysac |first3=Kathleen C. |last4=Billings |first4=Nicholas C. |last5=Leutenegger |first5=Christian M. |last6=Levy |first6=Alon M. |last7=Longeri |first7=Maria |last8=Niini |first8=Tirri |last9=Ozpinar |first9=Haydar 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of common crossbreeding, many cats are simply identified as belonging to the homogeneous breeds of [[domestic long-haired cat|domestic longhair]] and [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic shorthair]], depending on their type of fur.

=== Cat coat patterns and colors ===
These are discussed at [[Cat coat genetics#Cat coat patterns and colors|Cat coat genetics]].

=== Body types ===
Cats can also come in several body types, ranging between two extremes:

; Oriental: Not a specific breed, but any cat with an elongated slender build, almond-shaped eyes, long nose, large ears (the Siamese and [[Oriental Shorthair]] breeds are examples of this).
; Foreign: Less slender than the oriental type, but nevertheless a cat with a slight build and generally athletic look. Typical example breeds would be the [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian cat]] and the [[Turkish Angora]]. 
; Semi-Foreign: More or less the middle range of body conformation types, this type of cat is less slender without being stocky. Example breeds would be the [[Devon Rex]] and the [[Egyptian Mau]].
; Semi-Cobby: These cats look more rounded without looking too stocky. Example breeds would be the [[American Shorthair]] and [[British Shorthair]].
; Cobby: Any cat with a short, muscular, compact build, roundish eyes, short nose, and small ears. [[Persian cat]]s and [[Exotic Shorthair|Exotic cat]]s are two prime examples of such a body type.

== Effects on human health ==
Because of their small size, domesticated house cats pose little physical danger to adult humans. However, in the USA cats inflict about 400,000 bites per year. This number represents about one in ten of all animal bites.&lt;ref name=Kravetz/&gt; Many cat bites will become infected,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Talan DA, Citron DM, Abrahamian FM, Moran GJ, Goldstein EJ |title=Bacteriologic analysis of infected dog and cat bites.

[[Allergy|Allergic]] reactions to cat [[dander]] and/or cat saliva are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Erwin EA, Woodfolk JA, Custis N, Platts-Mills TA |title=Animal danders |journal=Immunol Allergy Clin North Am |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |year=2003 |pmid=14524386 |doi=10.1016/S0889-8561(03)00004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some humans who are [[Allergy to cats|allergic to cats]]—typically manifested by [[Allergic rhinitis|hay fever]], [[asthma]], or a skin [[rash]]—quickly acclimate themselves to a particular animal and live comfortably in the same house with it, while retaining an allergy to cats in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animaltrustees.org/ATA_Web/pdfs/dealingwithcatallergies.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070604203854/http://www.animaltrustees.org/ATA_Web/pdfs/dealingwithcatallergies.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2007 |title=Dealing with cat allergies|work=animaltrustees.org}}{{Better source|reason= Credentials of author unknown |date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the risk of developing allergic diseases such as asthma is increased or decreased by cat ownership is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00130832-200302000-00002|vauthors=Simpson A, Custovic A |title=Early pet exposure: friend or foe? |journal=Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2003 |pmid=12582308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Simpson A, Custovic A |title=Pets and the development of allergic sensitization |journal=Curr Allergy Asthma Rep |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=212–20 |year=2005 |pmid=15842959 |doi=10.1007/s11882-005-0040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some owners cope with this problem by taking allergy medicine, along with bathing their cats frequently, since weekly bathing will reduce the amount of dander shed by a cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

As well as posing health risks, interactions with cats may improve health and reduce physical responses to stress: for example the presence of cats may moderate increased [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=K. |last2=Blascovich |first2=J. |last3=Mendes |first3=W. B. |title=Cardiovascular reactivity and the presence of pets, friends, and spouses: the truth about cats and dogs |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=727–739 |year=2002 |pmid=12271103 |doi=10.1097/01.PSY.0000024236.11538.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cat ownership may also improve psychological health by providing emotional support and dispelling feelings of depression, anxiety and loneliness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogle&quot; &gt;{{Cite book |last=Fogle |first=Bruce (ed.) |title=Interrelations Between People and Pets |year=1981 |publisher=Charles C. Thomas Pub. Ltd. |isbn=0-398-04169-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23–56}} Their ability to provide companionship and friendship are common reasons given for owning a cat.&lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt;

From another point of view, cats are thought to be able to improve the general [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] of their owners by alleviating negative attitudes. According to a Swiss study carried out in 2003, cats may change the overall psychological state of their owner as their company's effect appears to be comparable to that of a human partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner 2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Dennis C. |last2=Rieger |first2=G. |last3=Gygax |first3=L. |url= http://en.scientificcommons.org/20081280 |title=Abstract: 'Spouses and Cats and Their Effects on Human Mood' |journal=ScientificCommons.org |publisher=magazine.One UG |location=Berlin |year=2003 |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that, while cats were not shown to promote positive moods, they do alleviate negative ones.

One study found that cat ownership is associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes at the 95% confidence interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Qureshi |first1=A. I. |last2=Memon |first2=M. Z. |last3=Vazquez |first3=G. |last4=Suri |first4=M.

Several studies have shown that cats develop affection towards their owners. However, the effect of these pets on human health is closely related to the time and effort the cat owner is able to invest in it, in terms of bonding and playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Beneficial Effects of Pet Ownership on Some Aspects of Human Health and Behaviour |date=3 October 2011 |pmc=1295517 |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=1774745 |last=Serpell |first=J. |pages=717–720 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indoor scratching ==
A natural behavior in cats is to hook their front claws periodically into suitable surfaces and pull backwards. Cats, like humans, keep their muscles trim and their body flexible by stretching.  Additionally, such periodic scratching serves to clean and sharpen their claws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Landsberg GM |title=Feline scratching and destruction and the effects of declawing |journal=Vet. Clin. North Am. Small Anim. Pract. |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=265–79 |year=1991 |pmid=2053250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indoor cats may benefit from being provided with a [[scratching post]] so that they are less likely to use carpet or furniture, which they can easily ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAB Information Sheet: Scratching or Clawing in the House |url= http://www.fabcats.org/behaviour/scratching/info.html |date=February 2008 |work=FABCats.org |publisher=Feline Advisory Bureau |location=Tisbury, England |accessdate=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some cats may simply ignore such a device. Commercial scratching posts typically are covered in carpeting or upholstery. Using a plain wooden surface, or reversing the carpeting on the posts so that the rougher texture of the carpet backing, may be a more attractive alternative to the cat than the floor covering. Scratching posts made of [[sisal]] rope or [[corrugated fiberboard|corrugated cardboard]] are also common.

[[File:Cat claw closeup.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a cat's claw.]]
Although scratching can serve cats to keep their claws from growing excessively long, their nails can be trimmed if necessary. Another response to indoor scratching is [[onychectomy]], commonly known as declawing. This is a surgical procedure to remove the claw and first bone of each digit of a cat's paws. Declawing is most commonly only performed on the front feet. A related procedure is [[tendonectomy]], which involves cutting a tendon needed for cats to extend their claws.&lt;ref name=Swiderski&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swiderski J |title=Onychectomy and its alternatives in the feline patient |journal=Clin. Tech. Small Anim. Pract. |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=158–161 |year=2002 |pmid=12587280 |doi=10.1053/svms.2002.36604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declawing is a major surgical procedure and can produce pain, and  infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swiderski&quot;/&gt;

Since this surgery is almost always performed for the benefit of owners, it is controversial and remains uncommon outside of North America.&lt;ref name=AMAwelfare&gt;[https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Backgrounders/Pages/Welfare-Implications-of-Declawing-of-Domestic-Cats-Backgrounder.aspx Welfare Implications of Declawing of Domestic Cats] ''American Veterinary Medical Association'' 9 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, declawing is prohibited by [[animal welfare]] laws and it is ethically controversial within the veterinary community.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patronek |first=G. J. |title=Assessment of claims of short- and long-term complications associated with onychectomy in cats |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med.

== Waste ==
Being fastidious self-cleaners, cats detest their own waste and instinctually bury their urine and feces. Indoor cats are usually provided with a box containing [[Litter box|litter]], generally consisting of [[bentonite]], but sometimes other absorbent material such as shredded paper or wood chips, or sometimes [[sand]] or similar material can be used. It should be cleaned daily and changed often, depending on the number of cats in a household and the type of litter; if it is not kept clean, a cat may be fastidious enough to find other locations in the house for urination or defecation. This may also happen for other reasons; for instance, if a cat becomes [[constipation|constipated]] and defecation is uncomfortable, it may associate the discomfort with the litter box and avoid it in favor of another location.

Daily attention to the litter box also serves as a monitor of the cat's health. Bentonite or clumping litter is a variation which absorbs urine into clumps which can be sifted out along with feces, and thus stays cleaner longer with regular sifting, but has sometimes been reported to cause health problems in some cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8888544 |year=1996 |last1=Hornfeldt |first1=CS |last2=Westfall |title=Suspected bentonite toxicosis in a cat from ingestion of clay cat litter |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=365–6 |journal=Veterinary and human toxicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toilet Trained Cat 22 Aug 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A toilet-trained house cat]]
Some cats can be trained to use the human toilet, eliminating the litter box and its attendant expense, [[Odor|unpleasant odor]], and the need to use landfill space for disposal.

An exhibit at the [[San Diego Natural History Museum]] states that cat feces from [[urban runoff]] carry [[Toxoplasma gondii]] parasites to the ocean and kill [[sea otter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-csgc.ucsd.edu/RESEARCH/PROJPROF_PDF/Conrad_CZ169.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic similarities with humans==
The order of eight [[gene]]s on the cats' [[Y chromosome]] closely resembles that in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;GNN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/04_00/cat_humans.shtml|title=Cats and humans share similar X and Y chromosomes|author=Sharon Guynup|publisher=[[Genome News Network]]|date=April 21, 2000| accessdate =14 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes on [[X chromosome]]s of cats and humans are arranged in similar way.&lt;ref name=&quot;GNN&quot;/&gt;

Domestic cats are affected by over 250 naturally occurring [[Genetic disorder|hereditary disorders]], many of which are similar to those in humans, such as [[diabetes]], [[haemophilia|hemophilia]] and [[Tay–Sachs disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GNN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://genome.cshlp.org/site/press/CatGenomeSequence.xhtml|title=Domestic cat genome sequenced|publisher=''[[Genome Research]]''| accessdate =14 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Abyssinian cat]]'s pedigree contains a [[Mutation|genetic mutation]] that causes [[retinitis pigmentosa]], which also affects humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR&quot;/&gt; The domestic cat is also an excellent model for human infectious diseases, including [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR&quot;/&gt; [[Feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV) is a genetic relative of [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR&quot;/&gt;

'''Operation Cat Drop''' is the name commonly given to an account, of uncertain veracity, about the delivery, by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Air Force]], of cats to a remote village in [[Sarawak]], [[Borneo]]. The cats were delivered in crates, dropped by parachute, as part of a broader program of supplying cats to combat a plague of rats. The cat population had previously been reduced as an unintended consequence of spraying [[DDT]] for [[malaria]] control. The story, often with various elaborations is often told as an illustration of the problems that may arise from well-intended interventions in the environment, or of [[unintended consequences]] more generally.

It is not clear whether the events of the Operation Cat Drop story actually transpired as the story is commonly told or if the cats were ever delivered by parachute. While cats are indeed unusually susceptible to the toxic effects of DDT, and cat die-offs were a not unheard of side effect of malaria control operations, many aspects of the story have been called into question. For example, it was probably [[dieldrin]] rather than DDT which was used for malaria control in the region and caused numerous cat deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18799776&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Shaughnessy PT |title=Parachuting cats and crushed eggs the controversy over the use of DDT to control malaria |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=98 |issue=11 |pages=1940–8 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18799776 |pmc=2636426 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.122523 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18799776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feral cat 1.JPG|thumb|300px|Feral cat with a tipped ear indicating it was neutered in a [[trap-neuter-return]] program]]

A '''feral cat''' is a [[cat]] that lives outdoors and has had little or no human contact. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and will run away if they are able. They typically remain hidden from humans, although some feral cats become more comfortable with people who regularly feed them. Even with longterm attempts at socialization, feral cats usually remain fearful and avoidant of humans.

Feral cats often live outdoors in colonies in locations where they can access food and shelter. These colonies are called ''managed colonies'' when they are provided with regular food and care by humans. Some animal rescue groups provide care for feral cats by implementing [[trap-neuter-return]] programs, feeding the cats, socializing and adopting out young kittens, and providing healthcare. 

Attempts to control feral cat populations are widespread, although the techniques differ significantly. Some advocate for trap-neuter-return programs to prevent the cats from continuing to breed; others suggest euthanasia.

The meaning of the term ''feral cat'' varies between professions and countries, and is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms such as ''free-roaming'', ''street'', ''alley,'' or ''community cat''. Some of these terms are also used to refer to stray cats, although stray and feral cats are generally considered to be different by [[Animal rescue group|rescuers]], [[Veterinary physician|veterinarians]], and researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot; /&gt; Stray cats are socialized cats who no longer live in homes, but could potentially be successfully reintroduced to a home environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alleycat.org/StrayorFeral|title=Feral and Stray Cats—An Important Difference|publisher=Alley Cat Allies|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery]]'' found that rescuers and veterinarians in the [[United Kingdom]] tended to distinguish feral cats from domesticated cats based on traits such as their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and on the amount of fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. They found that rescuers and veterinarians tended to agree that feral cats were cats that had not had much human contact (particularly before eight weeks of age), would try to avoid humans, and would prefer to escape rather than attack a human. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend to hiss and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult ferals could potentially be [[Tame animal|tamed]]. The article provided a composite definition of a feral cat as a cat that would choose not to interact with humans, could survive with or without human assistance, and would hide or defend itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Gosling|first1 = Lara|last2 = Stavisky|first2 = Jenny|last3 = Dean|first3 = Rachel|year = 2013|title = What is a feral cat?: Variation in definitions may be associated with different management strategies.|journal = Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|quote = PROPOSED DEFINITION: A feral cat is proposed by this study to be a cat that is unapproachable in its free-roaming environment and is capable of surviving with or without direct human intervention, and may additionally show fearful or defensive behaviour on human contact.|doi = 10.1177/1098612X13481034|pmid = 23966002|pages = 759–64|issue = 9|volume = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of rescuers and veterinarians in the [[United States]] found that there was no widely accepted definition of a feral cat. Many facilities used waiting periods to evaluate whether a cat was feral by observing whether the cat became less afraid and evasive over time. Other indicators included the cat's response to touch with an inanimate object, and observation of social behavior from the cat in varying environments (in response to human contact, with a human nearby, or when moved to a quieter environment).&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slater|first=Margaret R.|last2=Miller|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Weiss|first3=Emily|last4=Makolinski|first4=Kathleen V.|last5=Weisbrot|first5=Lila A.

The Australian government categorizes cats who have no interaction with or assistance from humans as feral, and unowned cats who rely on humans as [[semi-feral]] or stray.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsewpc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;daf&quot;&gt;{{Cite report|URL = https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/61987/IPA-Feral-Cat-Ecology-PA26.pdf|author = Department of Agriculture and Fisheries|date = March 2015|title = Feral cat|publisher = The State of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Farm cat ===
{{main article|Farm cat}}
[[File:Feral cat Virginia crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Feral farm cat]]
[[Farm cat]]s (also called barn cats) are cats that live on agricultural properties in [[feral]] or [[semi-feral]] condition. They primarily live outdoors, usually sheltering in outbuildings. They hunt [[vermin]] such as rodents and other small animals that live in or around outbuildings and farm fields.

The need to keep rodents from consuming or contaminating grain crops stored for later human consumption may be the original reason cats were domesticated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersen 1991&quot; /&gt; They are still commonly kept for the purpose of catching undesired vermin found on [[farm]]s and [[ranch]]es, which would otherwise eat or contaminate [[crops]], especially [[cereal|grain]] or [[fodder|feed]] stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/story/life/2016/02/05/geller-care-keeping-importance-barn-cats/78414844/|title=Geller: The care, keeping and importance of barn cats|last=Geller|first=Jon|date=5 February 2016|work=[[Fort Collins Coloradoan|Coloradoan]]|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animal rescue organizations maintain farm cat programs, where they place cats in barns whose owners agree to provide basic care for the animals. The cats in these programs are often feral cats who cannot safely be returned to their colonies, or cats who are semi-feral or otherwise difficult to adopt due to behavioral issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-frye/barn-cat-placement-progra_b_8334110.html|title=Barn Cat Placement Program: A Simple Shelter Solution|last=Frye|first=Elizabeth|date=October 20, 2015|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ship's cat===
{{main article|Ship's cat}}

[[Ship's cat]]s are typically feral or semi-feral, and were once common features on many trading, exploration, and naval ships. Cats were primarily brought aboard to catch mice and rats, which can cause damage to ropes, woodwork, and eventually as technology progressed, electrical wiring. Rodents also presented a threat to the stores the ship carried, both as cargo and as food for sailors. Rats and mice were also sources of [[disease]], which was dangerous for ships at sea for long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/cats-and-the-sea-services|title=Cats in the Sea Services|website=U.S. Naval Institute|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats have been officially banned from some commercial and military fleets, though they are sometimes still kept privately by sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=How domestic cats spread|encyclopedia=The Cat Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York, NY|date=16 June 2014|page=19|isbn=9781465419590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although scientists do not agree on whether cats were originally domesticated in [[Egypt]] or if they were introduced there after domestication, the spread of cats throughout much of the world is thought to have originated in Egypt, where they were popular and effective at controlling [[mouse]] populations. Traders from [[Phoenicia]] brought them to Europe to control [[rat]] populations, and monks brought them further into Asia. Roman armies also helped with the spread, eventually bringing them to [[England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersen 1991&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = History of domestic cats and cat breeds|date = 1991|encyclopedia = Feline Husbandry: Diseases and Management in the Multiple Cat Environment|publisher = American Veterinary Publications, Inc.|editor-last = Pedersen|editor-first = Niels C.|location = Goleta, CA|last = Wastlhuber|first = Joan|isbn = 978-0939674299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, cats continued to be introduced to new areas, often by sailors or settlers. Cats are thought to have been introduced to Australia in either the 1600s by Dutch shipwrecks, or the late 1700s by English settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsewpc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickman&quot;&gt;{{Cite report|title = Overview of the Impacts of Feral Cats on Australian Native Fauna|last = Dickman|first = Chris R.|date = May 1996|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/315373ff-04b3-49a7-ac5c-44f173e9b3f8/files/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|publisher = Australian Nature Conversation Agency and University of Sydney|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040904/http://secure.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These domesticated cats began to form feral populations after their offspring began living away from human contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickman&quot; /&gt;

==Behavior==
Some behaviors are commonly observed among feral cats, although there is disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers, and researchers on the prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid humans. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and back away or run when they are able to do so. If trapped, they may hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cat Culture: The Social World of A Cat Shelter|last=Alger|first=Janet M.|last2=Alger|first2=Steven F.|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4399-0772-6|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remain fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/feral_cats/qa/feral_cat_FAQs.html|title=Outdoor Cats: Frequently Asked Questions|date=8 January 2015|website=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonies ===
[[File:Herd of Cats.jpg|thumb|A colony of feral cats]]
Feral cats often live in ''colonies'', groups of feral cats that live together in one territory, often near food sources and shelter.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Researchers disagree on the existence, extent, and structure of [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]] within feral colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowell-Davis|first=Sharon L.|last2=Curtis|first2=Terry M.|last3=Knowles|first3=Rebecca J.|date=1 February 2004|title=Social organization in the cat: A modern understanding|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=6|issue=1|pages=19–28|doi=10.1016/j.jfms.2003.09.013|issn=1098-612X|pmid=15123163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of hierarchies have been observed in feral colonies, including [[Despotism|despotic]] and linear hierarchies. Some colonies are organized in more complex structures, such as relative hierarchies, where social status of individual cats can vary on their location, the time of day, or the activity the cats are engaged in (particularly feeding and mating).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social Behavior of Domestic Cats|last = Voith|first = Victoria L.|date = September 1986|journal = Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practising Veterinarian|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Borchelt|first2 = Peter L.|volume = 8|issue = 9|pages = 637–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonanni|first=Roberto|last2=Cafazzo|first2=Simona|last3=Fantini|first3=Claudio|last4=Pontier|first4=Dominique|last5=Natoli|first5=Eugenia|date=2007-11-01|title=Feeding-order in an urban feral domestic cat colony: relationship to dominance rank, sex and age|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1369–1379|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.02.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a human decides to care for a feral colony, it is often called a ''managed colony.'' The care given can include regularly supplying food and water to the cats, providing shelters, helping with [[trap-neuter-return]] programs, providing continued veterinary care, finding foster homes for cats that can be socialized for eventual adoption, and working to educate people who live in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/how-to-tnr/getting-started/the-7-steps-of-tnr|title=The 7 Steps of TNR|last=|first=|date=|website=Neighborhood Cats|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102033110/http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/how-to-tnr/getting-started/the-7-steps-of-tnr|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialization ===
[[File:Transformation of a stray kitten in 3 weeks after adoption.jpg|thumb|right|[[Socialization of animals|Socialization]] of a stray kitten over three weeks]]Feral kittens can be trapped and socialized, then adopted into a home. The age at which a kitten becomes difficult to socialize is not agreed upon, but suggestions generally range from seven weeks to four months of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Socialized Cat Guide|url = http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=289|website = Alley Cat Allies|accessdate = 30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Stray and Feral Cats|url = https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior/stray-and-feral-cats|website = ASPCA|accessdate = 30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although older cats can sometimes be socialized, it is a very long and difficult process, and the cat rarely becomes friendly and may remain fearful.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In a 2013 study of participants from the United Kingdom, rescuers tended to be more willing than veterinarians to attempt to tame adult feral cats. Veterinarians tended to be more opposed to this practice, with some expressing concerns for the welfare of such a cat in a home environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot; /&gt; In a 2010 study of veterinarians and rescuers in the United States, 66% of respondents had socialization programs for kittens, and 8% for adult cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

=== Diet and predators ===
[[File:Cat eating a rabbit.jpeg|thumb|Feral cats can be effective hunters of small animals.]]
Feral cats primarily subsist on food scavenged from [[Municipal solid waste|garbage]] when it is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=1012|title=Biology and Behavior of the Cat|website=Alley Cat Allies|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also eat animals they kill, and carcasses of animals already dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; Feral cats living in managed colonies are fed [[cat food]] by their caretakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=295|title=Colony Care Guide|website=Alley Cat Allies|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domesticated and feral cats have been observed to prey on a wide variety of both [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. Cats typically prefer smaller animals with body weights under {{Convert|100|g}}, particularly [[mammal]]s, birds, and lizards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimation of the dietary nutrient profile of free-roaming feral cats: possible implications for nutrition of domestic cats|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0007114511002285|journal = British Journal of Nutrition|date = 1 October 2011|issn = 1475-2662|pages = S35–S48|volume = 106|issue = Supplement S1|doi = 10.1017/S0007114511002285|first = Esther A.|last = Plantinga|first2 = Guido|last2 = Bosch|first3 = Wouter H.|last3 = Hendriks}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of studies of cat diet found that cats preyed on over 1,000 species. The analysis found [[House mouse|house mice]], [[European rabbit]]s, [[black rat]]s, [[house sparrow]]s, and [[common blackbird]]s were some of the most commonly observed prey species.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

Feral cats in Australia prey on a variety of wildlife. In [[arid]] and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] environments, they eat mostly [[introduced species|introduced]] European rabbits and house mice. In arid environments where rabbits do not occur, native rodents are taken. In forests and urbanized areas, they eat mostly native [[marsupial]]s (particularly the [[common ringtail possum]]) and rodents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickman&quot;/&gt;

Feral cats may be [[mesopredator]]s or [[apex predator]]s in some local ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, they may be preyed upon by animals such as [[Dog|feral dogs]], [[dingo]]es, [[coyote]]s, and [[bird of prey|birds of prey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dsewpc&quot;&gt;{{Cite report|URL = https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/34ae02f7-9571-4223-beb0-13547688b07b/files/cat.pdf|author = Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|date = 2011|title = The Feral Cat (Felis Catus)|publisher = Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Dingoes Ate My Kitten|url = https://www.wired.com/2015/05/let-dingoes-eat-kittens/|website = WIRED|publisher = WIRED|accessdate = 28 December 2015|last = Keim|first = Brandon|date = 4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus belong to the [[Retrovirus|''Retroviridae'']] family, and both cause [[immunosuppression]] in cats, which can increase their susceptibility to other infections. Research has shown that the prevalence of these viruses among feral cat populations is low and is similar to prevalence rates for owned cats in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12418520|year=2002|author1=Lee|first1=I.

Researchers studying 553 feral cats in Northern [[Florida]] in the United States tested them for a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'', the cause of [[cat-scratch disease]] in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. [[Feline coronavirus]] was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested did not appear to be a greater risk for [[Viral shedding|shedding]] the virus than pet cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Researchers studying 96 feral cats on [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada found that [[Toxocara cati|feline roundworm]] was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding ''T. gondii'' [[Apicomplexan life cycle|oocysts]]. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one [[intestinal parasite]], with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stojanovic|first=Vladimir|last2=Foley|first2=Peter|date=2011-09-01|title=Infectious disease prevalence in a feral cat population on Prince Edward Island, Canada|journal=The Canadian Veterinary Journal|volume=52|issue=9|pages=979–982|issn=0008-5286|pmc=3157072|pmid=22379197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transmission to humans ====
{{Main|Feline zoonosis}}
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] has warned about the rabies risk associated with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with rabies from exposure to rabid cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control rabies in dogs in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/17/feral-cats-colonies-rabies-risk/2665359/|title=Feral cat colonies could pose rabies risk, CDC says|last=Weise|first=Elizabeth Weise|date=18 August 2013|website=USA TODAY|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, there were 303 rabid cats reported within the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Although some colony management programs involve administering [[rabies vaccine]]s, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|post-exposure]] treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

The study of feral cats on Prince Edward Island warned of &quot;considerable [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] risk&quot; for transmission of intestinal parasites. Although the authors noted that their study did not provide evidence for great risk associated with ''T. gondii'' in cats, they advised that the risk should still be considered, as the infection in humans can cause significant health problems, and cats who are not otherwise transmitting the infection can begin shedding the virus in times of stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
Feral cats live on all continents except for Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/destination-wild/galleries/wild-side-of-cats/at/wide-eyed2-1005417/|title=Wild Side of Cats|website=Nat Geo WILD|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide feral cat population is estimated to be at least 100 million. The United States' feral cat population is estimated at 60 million, Australia's at 12 million, and Britain's at one million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/2013/08/27/global-impact-feral-cats/|title=The Global Impact of Feral Cats|last=McLamb|first=Eric|date=27 August 2013|website=Ecology Global Network|access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats are found on many remote islands, such as the [[Hawaiian Islands]], where they are an invasive species. Based on [[microsatellite]] genetic tests it was determined that these cats have a mainly European ancestry. This can be attributed to their travel on ship trading routes in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Katrin|last2=Algar|first2=Dave|last3=Schwenk|first3=Klaus|date=2016-08-01|title=Feral Cat Globetrotters: genetic traces of historical human-mediated dispersal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2261/abstract|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=6|issue=15|pages=5321–5332|doi=10.1002/ece3.2261|issn=2045-7758|pmc=4984506|pmid=27551385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most feral cats have small [[home range]]s, although some are more transient and travel long distances. The home ranges of male feral cats, which are generally two or three times larger than those of female cats, are on average under {{Convert|10|ha|lk=on}}, but can vary from almost {{Convert|300|ha}} to under {{Convert|1|ha}}. This variance is often due to breeding season, access to females, whether the cat is neutered, age, time of day, and availability of prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepczyk|first=Christopher A.|last2=Lohr|first2=Cheryl A.|last3=Duffy|first3=David C.|title=A review of cat behavior in relation to disease risk and management options|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=173|pages=29–39|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.07.002|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an Australian study emphasised the need to monitor the effects of culling programs after [[infrared camera]]s found that the culling of feral cats led to an increase in feral cat populations in the culled areas. It was thought that only dominant cats were being baited and trapped during such operations. After the removal of dominant cats, there was an influx of subordinate animals to the area which unlike the dominant cats, did not venture into the traps. Within a year cat numbers in culled areas stabilised to original numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2015/04/07/4203004.htm|title=Culling cats 'may do more harm than good'|last=Salleh|first=Anna|date=7 April 2015|website=ABC|language=en-AU|access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on wildlife==
{{main article|Cat predation on wildlife}}
Cats hunt small prey, such as rodents and birds. Free-ranging cats kill one to four billion birds and six to 22 billion mammals annually in the contiguous states of the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;NATURE.COMMUNICATIONS.1396&quot;&gt;{{cite report |last1=Loss|first1=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.|date=2012-09-06|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/full/ncomms2380.html|publisher=NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |section=Article number: 1396 |edition=Nature Communications 4, |access-date=2016-08-20 |quote=Here we conduct a systematic review and quantitatively estimate mortality caused by cats in the United States. We estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.3–4.0 billion birds and 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually. Un-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality. Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes feral cats kill non-native pests. Feral cats have been intentionally introduced to some areas as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] control strategy. In the 1800s, thousands of cats were introduced near settlements in Australia that had developed near [[Gold mining|gold dig]] sites and farms as an attempt to manage populations of mice, rabbits, and rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickman&quot; /&gt;

==Hybridisation with wild felids==
[[File:Kellas cat.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A [[Kellas cat]], a feline [[landrace]] resulting from crossbreeding between a domestic cat and a [[Scottish wildcat]] (''F. s. grampia'').]]
Feral cats have interbred with [[wildcat]]s to various extents throughout the world, the first reported case occurring more than 200 years ago. The significance of hybridisation is disputed.  Older documentation suggests that the wildcat was a separate species from the domestic cat, but modern genetic analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The noun ''pussy'' meaning &quot;cat&quot; comes from the [[Modern English]] word ''puss'', a conventional name or term of address for a pet cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED puss&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =puss, ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) says that [[cognate]]s are common to several [[Germanic language]]s, including [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''poes'' and [[Middle Low German]] ''pūse'', which are also used to call a cat. The word ''puss'' is attested in English as early as 1533. Earlier etymology is uncertain, but similar words exist in other European languages, including [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puisín'', both traditional calls to attract a cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED puss&quot;/&gt;

The words ''puss'' and derived forms ''pussy'' and ''pusscat'' were extended to refer to girls or women by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OED puss&quot;/&gt; This sense of ''pussy'' was used to refer specifically to genitalia by the eighteenth century, and from there further extended to refer to sexual intercourse involving a woman by the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED 1&quot; /&gt;

[[Noah Webster]], in his original 1828 ''[[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', defined ''pussy'' as: &quot;inflated, swelled; hence, fat, short and thick; and as persons of this make labor in respiration, the word is used for short breathed&quot;. He gave ''pursy'' as a &quot;corrupt orthography&quot; or misspelling of ''pussy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster |first=Noah |title=An American Dictionary of the English Language |year=1828 |location=New York |publisher=S. Converse |oclc=468942038}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, however, ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' reversed the original, suggesting that ''pussy'' was a &quot;colloquial or low&quot; variant of ''pursy''. That word, in turn, was defined as &quot;fat and short-breathed&quot;, with etymology from [[Old French]] ''pousser'' &quot;to push&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster |first1=Noah |last2=Porter |first2=Noah |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language |year=1913 |location=Springfield, MA |publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam |oclc=504785161 |pages=1166–1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Webster's Third International Dictionary'' points out similarities between ''pussy'' in the sense of &quot;vulva&quot; and Low German or Scandinavian words meaning &quot;pocket&quot; or &quot;purse&quot;, including [[Old Norse]] ''pūss'' and [[Old English]] ''pusa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gove |first=Phillip |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |year=1961 |location=Springfield, MA |publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam |isbn=978-0-8777-9302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval [[French language|French]] word ''pucelle'', meaning &quot;maiden&quot; or &quot;virgin&quot;, is not related to the English word. It is attested in Old French from the ninth century, and likely derives from [[Latin]]. The precise Latin source is disputed, with either ''puella'' &quot;girl&quot; or ''pulla'' &quot;[[pullet]], young female chicken&quot; suggested as earlier sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pucelle, ''n''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[homograph]], ''pussy'' also has the meaning &quot;containing [[pus]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;OED 3&quot; /&gt; with this meaning, the word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|s|ɪ}}, while the other forms are all pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʊ|s|ɪ}}. Another adjective is the rare or obsolete [[Northern England English|Northern English]] dialect form ''pursy'' meaning &quot;fat&quot; or &quot;short-winded&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED 2&quot; /&gt; 

Meanings of the verb relate to the common noun senses, including &quot;to act like a cat&quot;, &quot;to act like a coward&quot;, or &quot;to have sex with a woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED verb&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussy, ''v''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Add modern slang senses: man (especially prisoner) used unwillingly for another man's sexual gratification; submissive subordinate or underling. --&gt; Adjective meanings are related to the noun.

== Uses ==

=== Cat and similar ===
[[File:Salix caprea 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Male [[catkin]]s from a [[Salix caprea|pussy willow]]]]
Both in English and in [[German language|German]] ''puss'' was used as a &quot;call-name&quot; for cats, but in English ''pussy'' was used as a synonym for the word ''cat'' in other uses as well. In addition to cats, the word was also used for [[rabbit]]s and [[hare]]s as well as a humorous name for [[tiger]]s. In the 19th century,  the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry. ''[[Pussy willow]]'', for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus ''[[Salix]]'' with furry [[catkin]]s. In [[thieves' cant]] the word ''pussy'' means a &quot;fur coat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED 1&quot; /&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives as the first meaning of the noun: &quot;Chiefly colloq[uial]. A girl or woman exhibiting characteristics associated with a cat, esp[ecially] sweetness or amiability. Freq[uently] used as a pet name or as a term of endearment.&quot; The examples it cites from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries are not sexual. Another example, not cited by the OED, is one of the main characters of [[E. Nesbit]]'s ''[[Five Children and It]]'' - Jane, nicknamed Pussy by her siblings.

The verb ''pussyfoot'', meaning to walk softly or to speak in an evasive or cautious manner, may come from the adjective ''pussy-footed'' &quot;having a cat-like foot&quot;, or directly from the noun ''pussyfoot''. This word, first attested in the late nineteenth century, is related to both the &quot;cat&quot; and the &quot;woman&quot; meanings of ''pussy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussyfoot, ''v''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female genitalia ===

[[File:Pussyhat Project hat.jpg|right|thumb|Woman wearing a &quot;pussyhat&quot;|108x108px]]
In contemporary English, use of the word ''pussy'' to refer to women is considered derogatory or demeaning, treating people as sexual objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James |first=Deborah |title=Gender-linked derogatory terms and their use by women and men |journal=American Speech |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=399–420 |year=1998 |doi=10.2307/455584}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reference to genitals or to sexual intercourse, the word is considered vulgar slang. Studies find the word used more commonly in conversations among men than in groups of women or mixed-gender groups, though subjects report using ''pussy'' more often than other slang terms for female genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkins |first1=Lawrence |last2=Rinck |first2=Christine |title=Male and female sexual vocabulary in different interpersonal contexts |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=160–172 |year=1982 |doi=10.1080/00224498209551146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Donald Trump]]'s use of the word to describe his interactions with women (&quot;grab them by the pussy&quot;, known as the [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording|Billy Bush recording]]) provoked strong reactions by media figures and politicians across the political spectrum; an image of a snarling cat with the slogan &quot;pussy grabs back&quot; became a &quot;rallying cry for female rage against Trump&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Puglise, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-pussy-grabs-back-meme-women-twitter 'Pussy grabs back' becomes rallying cry for female rage against Trump], ''The Guardian'' (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Pink &quot;pussyhats&quot; (knitted caps with cat-like ears) were a notable feature of [[2017 Women's March|the worldwide protests]] held the day after Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kurtzleben|first1=Danielle|title=With 'Pussyhats,' Liberals Get Their Own Version Of The Red Trucker Hat|url=http://www.npr.org/2017/01/21/510997192/with-pussyhats-liberals-get-their-own-version-of-the-red-trucker-hat|accessdate=January 22, 2017|work=NPR.org|date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words referring to cats are used as vulgar slang for female genitals in some other European languages as well. Examples include German ''Muschi'' (literally &quot;house cat&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=O. Thyen |editor2=M. Clark |editor3=W. Scholze-Stubenrecht |editor4=J.B. Sykes |title=The Oxford-Duden German Dictionary|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; French ''chatte'' (&quot;female cat&quot;, also used to refer to sexual intercourse),&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rey|first=Alain|title=Le Nouveau Petit Robert Dictionnaire De La Langue Francais|year=2000|isbn=978-2-85036-668-0|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dutch ''poes'' (&quot;puss&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;OED puss&quot; /&gt; The Portuguese term ''rata'' (literally &quot;female rat&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Maria F.|title=The Routledge Portuguese Bilingual Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-99725-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Norwegian ''mus'' (&quot;mouse&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirkeby |first=Willy |year=1989 |title=English–Norwegian Dictionary |location=Bergen |publisher=Norwegian University Press |isbn=978-8200182931}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also animal terms used as vulgar slang for women's genitals.

=== Weakness ===
{{see also|Gender role}}
The word ''pussy'' is also used in a derogatory sense to mean cowardly, weak, or easily fatigued. The ''Collins Dictionary'' says: {{nowrap|&quot;(}}taboo, slang, mainly US) an ineffectual or timid person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pussies online]&lt;/ref&gt; It may refer to a male who is not considered sufficiently masculine, as in: &quot;The coach calls us pussies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim McKay|author2=Michael A. Messner|author3=Donald Sabo|title=Masculinities, Gender Relations, and Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Osehn3at7GoC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2000|publisher=SAGE |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men who are dominated by women (particularly by their partners or spouses and at one time referred to as 'hen-pecked', see [[pecking order]]) can be referred to as ''pussy-whipped'' (or simply ''whipped'' in slightly more polite society or media).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This may be used simply to denigrate a man who is contented in a relationship. The hyphenated phrase is parsed as &quot;whipped by pussy&quot; – a manipulative relationship dynamic wherein a female deliberately or subconsciously [[sex strike|withholds sexual intercourse]] to coerce the male into surrendering power in other aspects of the relationship. The male's weakness is his desire for access to female genitalia, and his willingness to weaken his position in the relationship to obtain that access, combining two uses of the word pussy.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Word-play between meanings ==
[[File:BarrisonPussy.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Barrison Sisters]] lift their dresses to show a live kitten, a double entendre of &quot;pussy&quot;.]]
'''Pussy''' is one of a large number of English words that has both erotic and non-erotic meanings. Such [[double entendre]] has long been used in the creation of sexual humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lefcourt |first1=Herbert |last2=Sordoni |first2=Carl |last3=Sordoni |first3=Carol |title=Locus of control and the expression of humor |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=130–143 |year=1974 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.ep8969660}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double entendre has been used for over a hundred years by performers, including the late-19th-century [[vaudeville]] act the [[Barrison Sisters]], who performed the notorious routine &quot;Do You Want To See My Pussy?&quot; in which they raised their skirts to reveal live kittens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverton|first=Peter|title=Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSErq0ssG74C&amp;pg=PT182|year=2011|publisher=Granta Publications|isbn=978-1-84627-452-7|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British comedy ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' the character [[Mrs. Slocombe]] often expressed concern for the welfare of her pussy. The double entendre made every reference to her cat seem to be a salacious and therefore humorous reference to her vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosewarne|first=Lauren|title=American Taboo: The Forbidden Words, Unspoken Rules, and Secret Morality of Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWijAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39934-3|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002 film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' a rapper insults his rivals by including the line, &quot;How can six dicks be pussies?&quot; The line relies on double meanings of both [[Dick (slang)|''dick'']] (either &quot;contemptible person&quot; or &quot;male genitalia&quot;) and ''pussy'' (&quot;weak&quot; or &quot;female genitalia&quot;). Such [[word play]] presents a challenge for translators of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taivalkoski-Shilov |first=Kristiina |title=Subtitling ''8 Mile'' in three languages: Translation problems and translator licence |journal=Target: International Journal of Translation Studies |year=2008 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=248–274 |doi=10.1075/target.20.2.04tai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pussy Riot]] is a Russian radical [[feminist]] punk-rock collective that stages illegal events in [[Moscow]] protesting the President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the status of women in Russian society. Band member &quot;Kot&quot; says that she knows how the word is used in English, and that it is also used in Russian as term of endearment for little girls. These various meanings create a tension with the word &quot;riot&quot;, which the group likes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pussy Riot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flintoff|first1=Corey|title=In Russia, Punk-Rock Riot Girls Rage Against Putin|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/02/08/146581790/in-russia-punk-rock-riot-girls-rage-against-putin|website=nrp.org|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cat café''' is a theme [[café]] whose attraction is [[cat]]s that can be watched and played with. Patrons pay a [[Cover charge|cover fee]], generally hourly, and thus cat cafés can be seen as a form of supervised indoor [[pet rental]].

== Etymology ==
''Cat café'' has been officially recognized in the online edition of the [[Oxford Dictionary of English]] since August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New words in oxforddictionaries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/hangry-bants-fatberg-new-words-in-oxforddictionaries|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/27/us-life-manspread-idUSKCN0QW1Y620150827|title = Manspreading, hangry, Grexit join Oxford online dictionary|date = 27 August 2015|work = |access-date = |publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world's first cat café, &quot;Cat Flower Garden&quot; (貓花園&lt;ref name=&quot;NBP&quot;&gt;[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei BP]] : [http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/column/20080422/1009762/ Article on 2 May 2008] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;), opened its doors in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_20120402&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120402-worldwide-weird-feline-fun-in-japans-cat-cafes|title=BBC - Travel - Feline fun in Japan's cat cafes|first=Lindsey | last=Galloway|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiwanese cat café eventually became a tourist destination, attracting tourists from Japan as well as all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/56592/brief-history-cat-cafe|title=A Brief History of the Cat Café|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the origin of cat café is in Taiwan, the concept blossomed in Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_20120402&quot;/&gt; where the first one named &quot;Neko no Jikan&quot; (lit. &quot;Cat's Time&quot;) was opened in [[Osaka]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBP&quot;/&gt; Due to the Japan's land size and population, many residents live in small apartments or condominiums which do not allow pets, making a cat café a very popular destination for young workers looking for the companionship and comfort offered. Tokyo's first cat café, named &quot;Neko no mise&quot; (Shop of Cats), opened in 2005. After this, the popularity of cat cafés boomed in Japan. From 2005 to 2010, seventy-nine cat cafés opened across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/meow-meow-meow-329-v17n2|title=Meow Meow Meow|first=Tomo | last=Kosuga|work=VICE|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In the United Kingdom animal charities disagree on whether cat cafés are a suitable environment for cats with the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]], [[Cats Protection]] and the [[Celia Hammond#Celia Hammond Animal Trust|Celia Hammond Animal Trust]] criticizing them for keeping large numbers of cats in a confined space with a revolving population of people. International Cat Care takes a more positive view saying &quot;It is a difficult environment to get right but it's not impossible by any means&quot;. However, all the charities agree that cat cafés need to be properly regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are cat cafes good for cats?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37199653|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cat cafés are quite popular in Japan, with [[Tokyo]] being home to 58 cat cafés as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/tokyo-cat-cafe-shut-down-animal-neglect-063457497.html?ref=gs|title=Tokyo cat cafe shut down for animal neglect|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was {{nihongo|''Cat's Store''|猫の店|Neko no Mise}}, by Norimasa Hanada, which opened in 2005. The popularity of cat cafés in Japan is attributed to many apartments forbidding pets, and to cats providing relaxing companionship in what may otherwise be a stressful and lonesome urban life. Other forms of [[pet rental]], such as rabbit cafés, are also common in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120216f2.html?fb_ref=article_japantimes Tokyo's rabbit cafes hopping with customers].&quot; ''[[The Japan Times]]''. 16 February 2012. Retrieved on 13 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various types of cat cafés in Japan. Some feature specific categories of cat such as [[black cat]]s, fat cats, rare [[cat breed|breed]] cats or ex-[[feral cat|stray cat]]s. Every cat café in Japan is required to obtain a license and comply with the strict requirements and regulations of the nation's Animal Treatment and Protection Law.&lt;ref&gt;Iwata, Mamiko, [[About.com|All About]] : [http://allabout.co.jp/pet/cat/closeup/CU20100051A/ Article on 7 March 2010] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese cat cafés feature strict rules to ensure cleanliness and animal welfare, in particular seeking to ensure that the cats are not disturbed by excessive and unwanted attention, such as by young children or when sleeping. Many cat cafés also seek to raise awareness of cat welfare issues, such as abandoned and stray cats and many often have cats from local animal shelters to help them lose any fear of humans and advertise them for possible adoption. From 2012 the cats could be displayed until 8&amp;nbsp;pm, but in 2016 the guidelines of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|environment ministry]] state that they may visit  and play with customers until 10&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/wtf/cats-at-japans-cat-cafes-now-allowed-to-stay-up-till-10pm/news-story/ab6955ba24d2af012438cd4c6b999c4a Cats at Japan's ‘cat cafes’ now allowed to stay up till 10pm 28 April 2016] ''News.com.au'' Retrieved 3 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

One café in Tokyo added goats as a way of having a unique element.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jul/11/tokyo-cafe-goats-video Tokyo cafe employs goats to add 'wow factor' - video].&quot; ''[[Reuters]]'' at ''[[The Guardian]]''. 11 July 2013.

The Singaporean Cat Cafes are regulated and licensed by [[Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore|AVA]] and they are all bound to a 'code of conduct'.  Individuals having questions with their cat needs, can join the Cat Welfare Society, which helps with medical fees, sterilization costs or adopting of the cats. Cat Cafes usually have their own/specific houserules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cat Cafe Houserules|url=http://thecatcafe.sg/cat-cafe-rules/T|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cat Cafe Neko no Niwa|url=http://www.catcafe.com.sg/cafe-rules/|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to local legend, the world's first cat café opened in Vienna in the summer of 1912 and ceased operation approximately two years later. It is said that Vladimir Lenin was a regular for a period in 1913, finding the feline companionship a comfort during his time of exile. The cat café is known to have ceased operation shortly after the beginning of the First World War, although the much repeated story that the closure was due to its patriotic owner's donating all the cats to a factory making fur-lined boots for the war effort may be apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-oldie/20151209/282218009716840|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 cat café Neko was opened in Vienna.

In the United States, compliance with governmental food service regulations is required.  The area where the cats are playing or being considered for adoption must be entirely separated from the area where food and drink are served. For example, a newly adopted cat must leave through a separate door without passing a food serving area.&lt;ref name=&quot;webcat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What's a Cat Cafe?|url=http://www.catcafesd.com/us/whats-a-cat-cafe/|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cat cafés in the United States differ from those in many other countries by their focus on adoptions. Hundreds of animals have been adopted through their efforts. In some cases, adoptions are completed for customers visiting on vacation. For example, ''The Cat Cafe'' in [[San Diego]] has completed adoptions for customers visiting from [[Nebraska]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC7 San Diego&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Laura McVicker |title=Tourist Adopts Cat From Cat Cafe on Trip to San Diego |url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Tourist-Adopts-Cat-From-Cat-Cafe-on-Trip-to-San-Diego-319044081.html |publisher=NBC7 San Diego |date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

The '''[[genetics]] of [[cat]] coat''' coloration, pattern, length (short, medium or long), and texture is a complex subject, and many different [[gene]]s are involved.

==Cat coat patterns and colors==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}

Cat coat genetics can produce a variety of colors and coat patterns. These are physical properties and should not be confused with a breed of cat. Furthermore, cats may show the color and/or pattern particular to a certain breed without actually being of that breed. For example, cats may have point coloration, but not be [[Siamese cat|Siamese]].

[[File:Co-kbk-07-001.jpg|thumb|Blue (grey) and white bicolor cat]]
; [[Bicolor cat|Bicolor, Tuxedo, and Van]] :This pattern varies between the [[Bicolor cat#Tuxedo cats|tuxedo cat]] which is mostly black with a white chest, and possibly markings on the face and paws/legs, all the way to the ''Van'' pattern (so named after the [[Lake Van]] area in Turkey, which gave rise to the [[Turkish Van]] breed), where the only colored parts of the cat are the tail (usually including the base of the tail proper), and the top of the head (often including the ears). There are several other terms for amounts of white between these two extremes, such as ''Harlequin''. Bicolor cats can have as their primary (non-white) color black, red, any dilution thereof, and tortoiseshell (see below for definition).

[[File:Felis silvestris - July 2007-1.jpg|thumb|Mackerel tabby, showing the characteristic &quot;M&quot; on its forehead.]]
; [[Tabby]] :Striped, with a variety of patterns. The classic blotched tabby (or marbled) pattern is the most common and consists of butterflies and bullseyes. The mackerel or striped tabby is a series of vertical stripes down the cat's side (resembling the fish). This pattern broken into spots is referred to as a spotted tabby. In addition, the individual hairs in a tabby-patterned coat may be banded with different colors, hence a &quot;ticked&quot; tabby. The worldwide evolution of the cat means that certain types of tabby are associated with certain countries; for instance, blotched tabbies are quite rare outside NW Europe, where they are the most common type.

[[File:Curlycat02.jpg|thumb|Female tortoiseshell-and-white cat]]
; [[Tortoiseshell cat|Tortoiseshell]] and [[Calico cat|calico]]
: This cat is also known as a calimanco cat or clouded tiger cat, and by the abbreviation 'tortie'. In the cat fancy, a tortoiseshell cat is patched over with red (or its dilute form, cream) and black (or its dilute blue) mottled throughout the coat. Additionally, the cat may have white spots in its fur, which make it a 'tortoiseshell and white' cat; if there is a significant amount of white in the fur and the red and black colors form a patchwork rather than a mottled aspect, in North America the cat will be called a calico. All calicos are tortoiseshell (as they carry both black and red), but not all tortoiseshells are calicos (which requires a significant amount of white in the fur and patching rather than mottling of the colors). The calico is also sometimes called a tricolor cat. The Japanese refer to this pattern as ''mi-ke'' (meaning &quot;triple fur&quot;), while the Dutch call these cats ''lapjeskat'' (meaning &quot;patches cat&quot;). A true tricolor must consist of three colors: a reddish color, dark or light; white; and one other color, typically a brown, black, or blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Torties, Calicos and Tricolor Cats |first=Barbara |last=French |url= http://www.fanciers.com/cat-faqs/tricolors.shtml |work=Fanciers.com |accessdate=24 October 2005}}{{self-published source|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both tortoiseshell and calico cats are typically female because the coat pattern is the result of differential [[X chromosome]] [[x-inactivation|inactivation]] in females (which, as with all normal female mammals, have two X chromosomes). Conversely, cats where the overall color is ginger (orange) are commonly male (roughly in a 3:1 ratio). In a litter sired by a ginger tom, the females will be tortoiseshell or ginger. Male tortoiseshells can occur as a result of chromosomal abnormalities (often linked to sterility) or by a phenomenon known as [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], where two early stage embryos are merged into a single kitten.  The manifestation of coloured patches on both males and females is termed mosaicism.

[[File:Niobe050905-Siamese Cat.jpeg|thumb|[[Siamese cat]], classical colorpoint pattern]]

; [[Point coloration|Colorpoint]]
: The colorpoint pattern is most commonly associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter version of the same color on the rest of the body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a [[Mutation#Special classes|temperature sensitive mutation]] in one of the [[enzyme]]s in the [[metabolic pathway]] from [[tyrosine]] to pigment, such as [[melanin]]; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.

: The tyrosine pathway also produces [[neurotransmitter]]s, thus mutations in the early parts of that pathway may affect not only pigment, but also neurological development. This results in a higher frequency of [[strabismus|cross-eyes]] among colorpointed cats, as well as the [[White tiger#Genetics and albinism|high frequency of cross-eyes in white tigers]].

; White cats
[[File:Cat Gato branco.jpg|thumb|White cat]]
: True albinism (a mutation of the tyrosinase gene) is quite rare in cats. Much more common is the appearance of white coat color that is caused by a lack of [[melanocyte]]s in the skin. A [[Melanin#Genetic disorders and disease states|higher frequency of deafness in white cats]] is due to a reduction in the population and survival of melanoblast stem cells, which in addition to creating pigment-producing cells, develop into a variety of neurological cell types. White cats with one or two blue eyes have a particularly high likelihood of being deaf.

; Smoke cats
: The bottom eighth of each hair is white or creamy-white, with the rest of the hair being a solid color. Genetically this color is a non-[[agouti signalling peptide|agouti]] cat with the dominant inhibitor gene; a non-agouti version of the silver [[tabby cat|tabby]]. Smoke cats will look solid colored until they move, when the white undercoat becomes apparent. It is mostly found in [[cat breed|pedigreed cat]]s (especially longhair breeds) but also present in some [[domestic long-haired cat]]s.

== Genes involved in albinism, dominant white, and white spotting ==
[[File:Neighbours Siamese.jpg|thumb|250px|The temperature sensitive albino genotype c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; produces [[point coloration]] at body extremities where lower temperature allows the mutated tyrosinase enzyme to become active.]]

* The &quot;C&quot; gene codes for the enzyme [[tyrosinase]], the first step in pigment production. Its [[Recessive gene|recessive alleles]] determine whether a cat is a complete [[albinism|albino]] (pink-eyed) or a temperature sensitive albino. The temperature sensitive albino genotypes are c&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] (sepia), c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] (pointed), and c&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tonkinese cat|Tonkinese]] (mink). The c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; gene can turn a cat's eyes blue due to a reduced number of [[melanocytes]], affecting pigmentation of the eyes. If a cat has the dominant C allele, then the cat is non-albino and full pigment production occurs.
* The ''white masking'' gene, ''W/w''. The &quot;W&quot; gene prevents the normal replication and migration of pigment-producing cells during embryologic development. As a result, ''WW'' and ''Ww'' cats have a greatly reduced number of [[melanocytes]] and appear white, no matter what other color genes it may carry.  Only a cat that is [[homozygous]] [[recessive]] (''ww'') will express normal pigmentation. Thus, ''W'' is [[epistasis|epistatic]] to the other coat pigmentation genes. Some cats with the ''W'' allele of this gene are [[Congenital sensorineural deafness in cats|congenitally deaf]] and/or have depigmentation of the iris of one or both eyes, resulting in blue eye color. White cats are also more likely to get skin cancer.
* The ''white spotting'' or ''piebald spotting'' gene, ''S/s'', has variable expression, so that an ''SS'' cat often has more extensive white patching than an ''Ss'' cat. It is this gene that creates the familiar white blaze across the face, a white bib, ''tuxedo'' pattern, or dappled paws.  A hypothetical Sb allele (&quot;gloving gene&quot;) may cause the mittens in [[Birman]] and [[Snowshoe (cat)|Snowshoe]] breeds.{{cn|date=October 2017}}  Some researchers{{who|date=October 2017}} believe that there are separate white spotting genes for distinct forms of white pattern, such as the white locket that some cats have on their neck or bellies.

* The sex-linked ''red'' gene, ''O'', determines whether there will be red variations to fur color.&lt;ref name=&quot;fanciers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/color-genetics |title=Cat Colors FAQ: Cat Color Genetics |publisher=Fanciers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gene is located on the X chromosome.  In cats with red variants of fur tone, [[phaeomelanin]] (red pigment) completely replaces eumelanin (black or brown pigment).&lt;ref name=&quot;fanciers&quot;/&gt;
* Males have only one X chromosome, so only have one allele of this gene. O results in red variations, and o results in non-orange fur.
* Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two alleles of this gene. OO results in red toned fur, oo results in non-orange fur, and Oo results in a [[tortoiseshell cat]], in which some parts of the fur are red variants and others areas non-red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cats.about.com/od/felinegenetics/a/colorpatterns.htm |title=Feline Breeds, Domestic Cats and Color Patterns |publisher=Cats.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A cat with Oo and white spotting genes is commonly called a [[calico cat|calico]].  The reason for the patchwork effect in female cats heterozygous for the O gene (Oo) is [[X-inactivation]] – one or the other X chromosome in every cell in the embryo is randomly inactivated (see [[Barr body]]), and the gene in the other X chromosome is expressed.
* [[Rufous polygenes]], as yet unidentified, can affect the richness of the orange/red gene's expression.

For a cat to be tortoiseshell, calico, or one of the variants such as blue-cream or chocolate tortoiseshell, the cat must simultaneously express two [[allele]]s, ''O'' and ''o'', which are located on the [[XY sex-determination system|X chromosome]]. Males normally cannot do this, as they have only one X chromosome, and therefore only one allele, and so calico cats are normally only female. Male tortoiseshell or calico cats occur only if they have chromosomal abnormalities such as the genotype XXY (in which case they are [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]]), [[Mosaic (genetics)|chromosomal mosaicism]] (only portions of their cells have the genotype XXY, so these cats may be fertile), or [[Chimera (genetics)|chimerism]] (a single individual formed from two fused embryos, at least one of which was male). Approximately 1 in 3,000 calico/tortoiseshell cats are male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&amp;A=2209&amp;S=5 | title=Feline Fallacies | work=The Pet Connection | publisher=VeterinaryPartner.com | first=Gina | last=Spadafori | accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimericism (which may result in fertile male cats) appears to be the most common mechanism.

=== Genes ===
* The browning gene ''B/b/b&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' codes for tyrosinase related protein-1, an enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway for eumelanin pigment production. Its dominant form, ''B'', will produce black color.  Recessive variants are ''b'', producing brown (or ''chocolate''), and ''b&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' producing light brown or ''cinnamon''.
* ''Barrington Brown'' is a recessive browning gene that dilutes black to mahogany, brown to light brown and chocolate to pale coffee.  It is different from the browning gene and has only been observed in laboratory cats.
* The ''Dense pigment'' gene, ''D/d'', codes for [[melanophilin]], a protein involved in the transportation and deposition of pigment into a growing hair. When a cat has two of the recessive ''d'' alleles (Maltese dilution), black fur becomes &quot;blue&quot; (appearing gray), chocolate fur becomes &quot;lilac&quot; (appearing light brown), cinnamon fur becomes fawn, and orange fur becomes cream.
* Dilution modifier gene, Dm, &quot;caramelizes&quot; the dilute colors as a dominant trait. The existence of this phenomenon as a discrete gene is a controversial subject among feline enthusiasts.
*  A mutation at the extension locus ''E/e'' (the [[melanocortin]] receptor) changes black pigment to amber or light amber. This phenomenon was first identified in [[Norwegian forest cat|Norwegian Forest Cats]].
* A modifying factor has also been hypothesized in shaded silver and chinchilla [[Persian cat|Persians]] whose fur turns pale golden in adulthood, due to low levels of phaeomelanin production. These cats resemble shaded or tipped goldens, but are genetically shaded or tipped silvers. This is probably related to the phenomenon known as &quot;tarnishing&quot; in silvers.

One can deduce that a grey male cat with a white bib and paws, but showing no tabby pattern:
*has the ''o'' variant of the orange gene on its only X chromosome (because the grey color corresponds to black, not orange)
*has at least one ''S'' variant of the white Spotting gene (because it has the white bib and paws)
*has two ''w'' alleles (because it expresses a fur color)
*has the dominant ''B'' allele (because its fur color is a shade of black rather than brown)
*has two ''d'' (dilute) alleles (because its fur is grey, rather than black).

[[File:Mekong bobtail lynx point, Cofein Pride.jpg|thumb|250px|A tabby point on a Mekong bobtail.]]

* The [[agouti gene]], ''A/a'' which codes for [[agouti signaling protein]].  The dominant, wild-type ''A'' causes the agouti shift phenomenon which causes hairs to be black pigmented at the tips and orange pigmented at the roots (revealing the underlying tabby pattern), while the recessive ''non-agouti'' or &quot;hypermelanistic&quot; allele, ''a'', prevents this shift in the pigmentation pathway.  In its homozygous form, aa, this results in black pigment production throughout the growth cycle of the hair.  Thus, the non-agouti genotype (aa) masks or hides the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen (called &quot;ghost striping&quot;), especially in kittens.  The O allele is also [[epistatic]] over the aa genotype.  That is, the ''A'' to ''a'' mutation does not have a discernible effect on red or cream colored cats, resulting in these cats displaying tabby striping independent of their genotype at this locus.  This explains why you can usually see the tabby pattern in the orange patches of non-agouti tortoiseshell cats, but not in the black or brown patches.
* The primary [[tabby]] pattern gene, ''Mc/mc'', sets the basic pattern of stripes that underlies the coat: the basic wild-type tabby gene, ''Mc'', produces what is called a ''mackerel striped'' tabby (stripes look like thin fishbones and may break up into bars or spots); while a recessive mutant, ''mc'', produces a blotched or ''classic'' tabby pattern (broad bands, whorls, and spirals of dark color on pale background usually with bulls-eye or oyster pattern on flank), common in Iran, Great Britain and in lands that were once part of the British Empire and Persian Empire. The gene responsible for this differential patterning has been identified as ''transmembrane aminopeptidase Q'' (''Taqpep''), which also produces the [[king cheetah]] coat variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Specifying and Sustaining Pigmentation Patterns in Domestic and Wild Cats |author1=Kaelin CB |author2=Xu X |author3=Hong LZ |author4=David VA |author5=McGowan KA |author6=Schmidt-Küntzel A |author7=Roelke ME |author8=Pino J |author9=Pontius J |author10=Cooper GM |author11=Manuel H |author12=Swanson WF |author13=Marker L |author14=Harper CK |author15=van Dyk A |author16=Yue Bisong |author17=Mullikin JC |author18=Warren WC |author19=Eizirik E |author20=Kos L |author21=O'Brien SJ |author22=Barsh GS |author23=Menotti-Raymond M |year=2012 |journal=Science |pages=1536–1541|volume=337 |issue=6101 |pmid=22997338|doi=10.1126/science.1220893 |pmc=3709578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Secondary [[tabby]] pattern genes such as ''T&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; / t&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'', at which locus a dominant mutation produces an ''Abyssinian ticked'' or non-patterned agouti tabby, having virtually no stripes or bars.  (This is one type of unpatterned tabby; the other type of unpatterned tabby is the shaded/chinchilla. See inhibited pigment gene, below.)  The dominant ticked tabby allele masks all other tabby patterns.
* Other genes (''pattern modifier'' genes) are theorized to be responsible for creating various type of spotting patterns, many of which are variations on a basic mackerel or classic pattern.  There are also hypothetical factors which affect the timing and frequency of the agouti shift, affecting agouti band width and the number and quality of alternating bands of eumelanin and phaeomelanin on individual hairs.

=== Tabby cats ===
Tabby cats (AA or Aa), normally have:
* M on forehead. (Visible in ticked tabby cats, but hard to discern in shaded silver/golden, and tipped cats)
* Thin pencil lines on face. (Visible in ticked tabby cats, but hard to discern in shaded silver/golden, and tipped cats)
* Black &quot;eyeliner&quot; appearance and white or pale fur around eyeliner.
* Pigmented lips and paws.
* A pink nose outlined in darker pigment
* Torso, leg, and tail banding. (Torso banding disappears in the ticked tabby.)

Most or all striping disappears in the chinchilla or shaded cat, but it is still possible to identify the cat as a tabby from these other features.
* There is a gene, not yet identified but believed to be related to the agouti gene, in the [[Chausie]] breed, that produces silver-tipped black fur similar to [[Abyssinian cat|Abyssinian]] ticked fur. The &quot;grizzled&quot; phenomenon is purported to have been inherited from the hybridization of the domestic cat to the jungle cat (''Felis chaus'').
* The ''inhibited pigment'' gene, ''I/i''. The dominant allele (I) produces ''tipped'' hairs that are fully colored only at the tip and have a white base. This allele appears to interact with other genes to produce various degrees of tipping, ranging from deeply tipped silver tabby to lightly tipped shaded silver and chinchilla silver.  The inhibitor gene interacts with the non-agouti genotype (I-aa) to produce the color known as smoke. The homozygous recessive genotype when combined with the agouti gene (iiA-), produces tabby coloration, which can vary along a spectrum ranging from a deeply patterned brown tabby, to a lighter &quot;golden tabby&quot;, to the very lightly colored shaded or chinchilla golden colors. Orange cats with the inhibitor gene (I-O-) are commonly called &quot;cameo&quot;.

The genetics involved in producing the ideal tabby, tipped, shaded, or smoke cat is complex.  Not only are there many interacting genes, but genes sometimes do not express themselves fully, or conflict with one another.  For example, the melanin inhibitor gene sometimes does a poor job blocking pigment, resulting in an excessively gray undercoat, or in tarnishing (yellowish or rusty fur).

Likewise, poorly-expressed non-agouti or over-expression of melanin inhibitor will cause a pale, washed out black smoke. Various polygenes (sets of related genes), epigenetic factors, or modifier genes, as yet unidentified, are believed to result in different phenotypes of coloration, some deemed more desirable than others by fanciers.

=== Tipped or shaded cats ===
Here are the genetic influences on tipped or shaded cats:
* Agouti gene.
* Tabby pattern genes (such as T&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; masking the tabby pattern).
* Silver or melanin inhibitor gene.
* Factors affecting the number and width of bands of color on each hair (such as the hypothetical wide band gene).
* Factors affecting the amount and quality of eumelanin and/or phaeomelanin pigment expression (such as theorized rufousing factors)
* Genes causing sparkling appearance (such as ''glitter'' in the Bengal, ''satin'' in the Tennessee Rex, ''grizzle'' in the Chausie).
* Factors to clear up residual striping (hypothetical Chaos, Confusion, Unconfused, Erase, and Roan factors).

== Genes involved in fur length and texture ==

Cat fur length is governed by the ''Long hair'' gene in which the dominant form, ''[[domestic shorthaired cat|L]]'', codes for '''short''' hair, and the recessive ''[[domestic long-haired cat|l]]'' codes for '''long''' hair. In the longhaired cat, the transition from anagen (hair growth) to catagen (cessation of hair growth) is delayed due to this mutation. A rare recessive shorthair gene has been observed in some lines of Persian cat (silvers) where two longhaired parents have produced shorthaired offspring.

There have been many genes identified that result in unusual cat fur.  These genes were discovered in random-bred cats and selected for. Some of the genes are in danger of going extinct because the cats are not sold beyond the region where the mutation originated or there is simply not enough demand for cats expressing the mutation.

In many breeds, coat gene mutations are unwelcome. An example is the rex allele which appeared in Maine Coons in the early 1990s. Rexes appeared in America, Germany and the UK, where one breeder caused consternation by calling them &quot;Maine Waves&quot;. Two UK breeders did test mating which indicated that this was probably a new rex mutation and that it was recessive. The density of the hair was similar to normally coated Maine Coons, but consisted only of down type hairs with a normal down type helical curl, which varied as in normal down hairs. Whiskers were more curved, but not curly. Maine Coons do not have awn hairs, and after moulting, the rexes had a very thin coat.

=== Curly coated ===
There are various genes producing curly coated or &quot;rex&quot; cats.  New types of rex pop up spontaneously in random-bred cats now and then.  Here are some of the rex genes that breeders have selected for:

* r = [[Cornish Rex]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* gr (provisional) = [[German Rex]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]]. Same [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] as Cornish, but proposed as a different [[allele]]. However, most breeders consider the German Rex to have r/r genotype.
* re = [[Devon Rex]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* ro = [[Oregon Rex]] (extinct), [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* Se = [[Selkirk Rex]], [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant allele|dominant]] although sometimes described as an [[Dominance (genetics)#Incomplete dominance|incomplete dominant]] because the three possible allele pairings relate to three different phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume. (sese type cats have a normal coat.) This phenomenon may also colloquially be referred to as additive dominance.
* Lp (provisional) = [[LaPerm]], [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant allele|dominant]]: Lp/lp and Lp/Lp individuals have the same phenotype.

=== Hairlessness ===
There are also genes for hairlessness:
* h = French hairless cat, [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* hd = British hairless cat, [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* Hp = Russian Donskoy and [[Peterbald]], [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant allele|dominant]].
* hr = Canadian [[Sphynx (cat)|Sphynx cat]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].

Some rex cats are prone to temporary hairlessness, known as baldness, during moulting.

Here are a few other genes resulting in unusual fur:
* The Wh gene (dominant, possibly incomplete) results in [[American Wirehair|Wirehair]] cats.  They have bent or crooked hair producing springy, crinkled fur.
* A hypothetical Yuc gene, or [[York Chocolate cat|York Chocolate]] undercoat gene, results in cats with no undercoat. However, the proportional relationship between [[Guard hair|guard]], [[Awn hair|awn]], and [[down hair]] production varies greatly between all breeds.
* A recessive autosomal gene for ''Onion hair'' which causes roughness and swelling on the hairs.  The swelling is due to enlargement of the inner core of medulla cells.
* A recessive autosomal gene spf for ''sparse fur''.  As well as sparse coat, the hairs are thin, straggly and contorted and there is brown exudate around the eyes and nose and on the chest and stomach. A similar condition is linked to [[Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency]] in mice.

'''Pinch-induced behavioral inhibition''' ('''PIBI''') or '''clipnosis''' is a partially inert state which results from a gentle squeeze of the skin behind the [[neck]].  It is mostly observed among [[Felidae]] and allows the mother cat to easily carry her kitten with her jaws. It can be used to effectively restrain most cats in a domestic or veterinary context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While '''[[cat]]s''' have a variety of breeds and coats, [[pink]] is not a natural colour among them. Nevertheless, several instances of '''pink cats''' have been reported by the media, sometimes as a result of interference with chemicals or [[dye]]s rather than any [[Cat coat genetics|natural genetics]]. Additionally, several fictional pink cats have been used in popular culture.

==Real-life incidents==

[[File:Pink Cat 1.jpg|thumb|A bicolor pink-white cat and a bicolor orange-white cat]]
In September 2005, a cat, Brumas, briefly left his owners in [[Launceston, Cornwall]], and returned with his fur coloured pink. The cause of the colour change was not identified, but Brumas was examined by the [[RSPCA]] and found to have no toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4215890.stm|title=Cat in the pink over new colour|work=BBC News|date=5 September 2005|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, a cat with dyed pink fur was discovered in [[Swindon]]. The RSPCA called the dyeing a &quot;sick prank&quot; and were unable to wash the colour out of the cat's fur, though no side-effects were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-11407516|title='Sick prank' leaves cat dyed pink in Swindon|work=BBC News|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event made worldwide news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9036000/9036953.stm|title='Pink cat' puts Swindon on the global media map|work=BBC News|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the owner came forward and said the cat had been dyed pink using [[food colouring]] because she was a fan of the colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-11433213|title=Swindon pink cat owner will get pet back|work=BBC News|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said the act &quot;seemed like a good idea. I always wanted a pink animal&amp;nbsp;– a bit like my hair&quot; and insisted she read the instructions carefully, knowing that the colouring could not be toxic as it was intended for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8026990/Pink-cat-mystery-solved-owner-dyed-it-to-match-her-hair.html|title=Pink cat mystery solved: owner dyed it to match her hair|first=Heidi|last=Blake|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSPCA later confirmed they would not press charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8030933/Owner-who-dyed-cat-pink-reunited-with-pet-after-RSPCA-says-she-didnt-commit-a-crime.html|title=Owner who dyed cat pink reunited with pet after RSPCA says she didn't commit a crime|first=Laura|last=Roberts|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, four kittens were found abandoned in a concrete factory in [[Redruth]], Cornwall, one of which had pink fur. The charity [[Cats Protection]] attempted to wash out the colour with shampoo, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1388227/Pink-kitten-The-real-Pink-Panthers-fur-changed-colour-bathed-cement.html|title=The real Pink Panthers|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a report showed pollution from the [[Port Talbot Steelworks]] in [[Wales]] had turned cats both grey and pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robin |last=Turner |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/glitter-rain-pink-cat-town-1907905 |title=Glitter rain and pink cat town demands clean air  |date=14 July 2010 |website=Wales Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats having pinkish patches can be found in [[Bulgaria]]. The color is probably the result of a [[genetic mutation]] and is very close to orange. They are usually pink-white [[bicolor cat|bicolor]]; or pink-[[Russian Blue]]-white or pink-black-white [[calico cat]]s.

==In fiction==

The [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] is a cartoon character created by [[Friz Freleng]]. As well as featuring in the opening titles of the [[The Pink Panther|films]] starring [[Peter Sellers]], he has appeared in spin-off cartoon series. Animation historian [[Jerry Beck]] has said the character is &quot;anti-authority&amp;nbsp;– he's cool yet he's pink&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawaxpress.ca/2005/09/14/animation-fest-jerry-beck-on-the-pink-panther-struttin-with-the-pink-panther/|title=Struttin' with the pink Panther|newspaper=Ottawa Express|date=14 September 2005|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character of the children's television series ''[[Bagpuss]]'' was a pink cat. The puppet used for [[animation]] was originally supposed to be marmalade, but was dyed pink accidentally during the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.folkestoneherald.co.uk/firm-s-error-Bagpuss-kitty-pink/story-18011257-detail/story.html|title=How firm's error made Bagpuss a kitty in pink|newspaper=Folkestone Herald|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another children's television series, ''[[Roobarb and Custard]]'' featured a pink cat, Custard. Creator [[Grange Calveley]] based Custard's mannerisms on [[Sid James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/134651.stm|title=Reigning cat and dog|work=BBC News|date=30 July 1998|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[Florentijn Hofman]] created a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} tall pink cat as part of an exhibition in [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kfor.com/2014/06/01/colossal-pink-cat-makes-its-debut/|title=Colossal pink cat makes its debut|work=KFOR|date=1 June 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cat meat''' is meat prepared from [[domestic cat]]s for human consumption. Some countries eat cat meat regularly, whereas others have only consumed cat meat in desperation during wartime or poverty.

Prehistoric human feces have contained bones from the wild cat of Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaylorNegus1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Taylor|author2=Daphne Negus|author3=Dave King |author4=Jane Burton |title=The Ultimate Cat Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPdFgZzns30C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&amp;f=false|year=1989|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-68649-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures of [[Cameroon]], there is a special ceremony featuring cat-eating that is thought to bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2857891.stm|title= The cat eaters of Cameroon|publisher = BBC News | date=2003-03-17 | first=Francis | last=Ngwa-Niba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces in south-eastern [[China]], some—especially older—people consider cat flesh a good warming food during winter months. However, in northern China eating cat is considered unacceptable. &lt;ref name=Xinhuanet/&gt;

In Guangdong, cat meat is a main ingredient in the traditional dish &quot;[[Dragon tiger phoenix |dragon, tiger, phoenix]]&quot; (snake, cat, chicken), which is said to fortify the body.&lt;ref name=Xinhuanet&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2012-01/13/c_131358233.htm Some call it an indelicate trade, others, a delicacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314075006/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2012-01/13/c_131358233.htm |date=2017-03-14 }}, Xinhuanet.com, 13 Jan 2012 (from China Daily)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase of cats as pets in [[China]], opposition towards the traditional use of cats for food has grown. In June 2006, approximately 40 activists stormed the Fangji Cat Meatball Restaurant in [[Shenzhen]], forcing it to shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fangji Cat Meatball Restaurant (Reuters)&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-19T131415Z_01_PEK331544_RTRUKOC_0_US-CHINA-CATS.xml |accessdate=2006-10-22 |publisher=Reuters |title=Animal rights protest shuts restaurant |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713014909/http://today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded to more than 40 member societies, the [[Chinese Animal Protection Network]] in January 2006 began organizing well-publicized protests against dog and cat consumption, starting in [[Guangzhou]], following up in more than ten other cities &quot;with very optimal response from public.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guangzhou bans eating snakes--ban helps cats(Animal People)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/07/11/guangzhoubanseatingsnakes11_07.html |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Reuters via animalpeoplenews.org |title=Guangzhou bans eating snakes--ban helps cats |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304213111/http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/07/11/guangzhoubanseatingsnakes11_07.html |archivedate=2008-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
In Japan, cat meat was consumed until the end of [[Tokugawa period]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanleycat66&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Hanley|first = Susan|title = Everyday Things in Premodern Japan|year = 1997|page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawans]] once ate a cat soup called ''Mayaa no Ushiru'' ([[:ja:マヤーのウシル|マヤーのウシル]]).

=== Korea ===
In [[Korea]], cat meat was historically brewed into a tonic as a folk remedy for [[neuralgia]] and [[arthritis]]. Modern consumption is more likely to be as cat soup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saynotodogmeat.net/2014/02/19/boiled-alive-cat-meat-soup-south-korea/ |title=Boiled Alive Cat Meat Soup, South Korea |work=SAY NO TO DOG MEAT.NET |accessdate=22 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123001003/http://saynotodogmeat.net/2014/02/19/boiled-alive-cat-meat-soup-south-korea/ |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idausa.org/campaigns/dogs-cats/dogs-and-cats-of-south-korea/|title=Dog and Cat Meat Consumption – In Defense of Animals – In Defense of Animals|work=In Defense of Animals|accessdate=22 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123043818/http://www.idausa.org/campaigns/dogs-cats/dogs-and-cats-of-south-korea/|archivedate=23 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://our-compass.org/2012/04/09/ban-south-korean-dog-and-cat-meat-trade/|title=Ban South Korean dog and cat meat trade|work=Our Compass|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.examiner{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. com/article/south-korea-dog-cat-meat-industry-to-face-protests&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-Korea/KoreaDogMeatUpdate.htm|title=Important Update On South Korean Dog And Cat Meat Trade|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandogs.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023065537/http://koreandogs.org/ |archivedate=2015-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Cat meat is eaten in some parts of India, even though it is technically illegal.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} It is generally cooked with flavoured rice and is part of the main course during wedding feasts in the [[Narikurava]] community; cat soup is also served on the occasion of the birth of a male child.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffindia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=HuffingtonPost|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/11/01/for-biryani-in-chennai-cats-are-being-boiled-alive/?ncid=fcbklnkinhpmg00000001|title=For biryani in Chennai, cats are being boiled alive, sold for Rs 100 per kg|accessdate=November 3, 2016|date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland the private consumption and slaughter of dog and cat meat is permitted though its commercial trade is prohibited by law. A 1993 petition to ban consumption failed with the government declaring the matter a &quot;personal ethical choice.&quot;

===Denmark===
In June 2008, three students at the Danish School of Media and Journalism published pictures of a cat being slaughtered in ''Citat'', a magazine for journalism students. Their goal was to create a debate about [[animal welfare]]. The cat was shot by its owner, a [[farmer]], and it would have been [[animal euthanasia|put down]] in any case. The farmer [[animal slaughter|slaughtered]] the cat all within the limits of [[Law of Denmark|Danish law]]. This led to criticism from Danish animal welfare group Dyrenes Beskyttelse,&lt;ref name=&quot;Journalistelever spiser kat&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Walsh|first=Kevin|date=2008-06-05|title=Journalistelever spiser kat|trans_title=Journalism students eat cat |url=http://www.bt.dk/nyheder/journalistelever-spiser-kat|language=Danish |newspaper=[[B.T.

===United Kingdom===
In 18th-century Britain, there are a few records of cats being eaten as a form of entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cat Eaters&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/260/the_cat_eaters.html |accessdate=2009-10-12 |title=The Cat Eaters |publisher=forteantimes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521072202/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/260/the_cat_eaters.html |archivedate=2009-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In February 2010, on a television cooking show, the [[Italy|Italian]] food writer Beppe Bigazzi mentioned that during the famine in [[World War II]] cat stew was a &quot;succulent&quot; and well known dish in his home area of [[Valdarno]], [[Tuscany]]. Later he claimed he had been joking, but added that cats used to be eaten in the area during famine periods, historically; he was widely criticised in the media for his comments and ultimately dropped from the television network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article7029058.ece|title = Celebrity chef Beppe Bigazzi upsets viewers with his cat casserole|date = February 16, 2010 |publisher = The Times | location=London | first=Richard | last=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats were sometimes eaten as a [[famine food]] during harsh winters, poor harvests, and wartime. Cat gained notoriety as &quot;roof rabbit&quot; in [[Central Europe]]'s hard times during and between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.messybeast.com/eat-cats.htm |title=Cats - Friend Or Food |publisher=Messybeast.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cat consumption was a stereotype attributed to Vincenzans in [[Vicenza]], Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albala2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Albala|title=Food in Early Modern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4f-l3-KG0LcC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEIMTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31962-4|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the &quot;Butchers' Advocate, Dressed Poultry and the Food Merchant&quot; in 1904, ''&quot;Just before Christmas it is common for a group of young men in northern Italy to kill some cats, skin them and soak them in water for two or three days. They are cooked with great care on Christmas day and served up hot about 1.30 P. M., after mass. &quot;Many people in Italy, 'on the quiet,' keep cats like the English do rabbits—to kill. A catskin there is worth ten pence, as the material for muffs for girls. &quot;Extraordinary care has to be taken in procuring the animals, for the Italian Society for the Protection of Cats is vigilant, and offenses against the law are followed by imprisonment only. We have no fines in Italy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Butchers' Advocate, Dressed Poultry and the Food Merchant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5tRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP53&amp;dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEITzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&amp;f=false|year=1904|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to &quot;The Dietetic &amp; Hygienic Gazette&quot; in 1905, ''Italy cultivates the cat for home consumption as English people raise rabbits. It is to be done on the quiet, however, for in spite of the profit in the business and the demand for the delicacy, the law has to be looked out for, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Cats is vigilant. Offenses against the law are visited with imprisonment. Cats are raised for the market none the less. Fattened on the finest of milk, a choice specimen will attain the weight of fifteen pounds.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dietetic &amp; Hygienic Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3w3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&amp;f=false|year=1905|publisher=Gazette Publishing Company|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfEgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&amp;f=false|year=1905|publisher=Gazette Publishing Company|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and Spain===
There are recounts of cat being consumed in France's Gallia Norbon region and Spain in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albala2003&quot;/&gt;

==Oceania==
===Australia===
[[Indigenous Australians]] in the area of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory#Wild Cat Stew Challenge|Alice Springs]] roast feral cats on an open fire. They have also developed recipes for cat stew. Some other inhabitants of the area have also taken up this custom, justified on the grounds that felines are &quot;a serious threat to Australia's native [[fauna]]&quot;. Scientists warned that eating wild cats could expose humans to harmful [[bacteria]] and [[toxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6974687.stm|publisher= BBC News|title= Australians cook up wild cat stew | date=2007-09-02 | first=Phil | last=Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Americas==
===Peru===
Cat is not a regular menu item in [[Peru]], but is used in such dishes as [[fricassee]] and stews most abundant in two specific sites in the country: the southern town of [[Chincha Alta]] ([[Ica Region]], [[Afro-Peruvian]] mostly) and the north-central [[Andean]] town of [[Huari, Peru|Huari]] ([[Ancash Region]]). Primarily used by [[Afro-Peruvian]]s. Cat cooking techniques are demonstrated every September during the festival of [[Ephigenia|Saint Efigenia]] in a town of La Quebrada.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEATURE - 'Cat-eaters' take note - feline feast at Peru festival&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/12575/newsDate/28-Sep-2001/story.htm| accessdate=2008-02-16 | title='Cat-eaters' take note - feline feast at Peru festival|publisher = planetark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, a judge banned the annual El Festival Gastronomico del Gato (the Gastronomic Festival of the Cat), which was held every September in La Quebrada to commemorate the arrival of settlers who were forced to eat cats to survive, citing it as cruel to the 100+ cats specifically bred for the event, which involves being kept in cages for a year prior the Festival. The judge also cited concerns over the safety of the meat, which drew criticism from residents who contend that cat meat is far richer than rabbit or duck, and that it has been long consumed globally without any deleterious effects.&lt;ref&gt;Golgowksi, Nina (October 15, 2013). [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/judge-bans-peruvian-town-annual-cat-eating-festival-article-1.1486233 &quot;Judge bans Peruvian town's annual cat-eating festival&quot;]. ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' (New York).&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, magistrate Maria Luyo banned the festival of Curruñao in the small town of San Luis. Locals say that the festival, which sees cats being drowned, skinned and tied to fireworks and blown up, dates back to the practice of eating cat on the part of African slaves who worked on sugar-cane plantations in colonial times, and is part of the religious celebrations of [[Santa Efigenia]], an African-Peruvian folk saint. Luyo stated in her ruling that the festival &quot;fomented violence based on cruel acts against animals which caused grave social damage and damaged public health&quot;, and that minors could be &quot;psychologically damaged&quot; by watching the events.&lt;ref&gt;Collyns, Dan (October 18, 2013).

===Argentina===
In a 1996, report some citizens in a [[shanty town]] in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]], stated that, during an economic crisis, they had to feed the neighborhood children with cat's meat, and commenting, &quot;It's not denigrating to eat cat, it keeps a child's stomach full&quot;. The validity of this report has been questioned, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.infonews.com/nota/89339/nunca-se-comieron-los-gatos-en-rosario |title=Nunca se comieron gatos en Rosario |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106103721/http://tiempo.infonews.com/nota/89339/nunca-se-comieron-los-gatos-en-rosario |archivedate=2015-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish and Islamic tradition==
The [[Judaism|Jewish]] laws of [[kashrut]] and [[Islam]]ic [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] both [[taboo food and drink|forbid]] the consumption of cat meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|21|4752}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashrut disallows the consumption of any terrestrial predators. To be considered kosher in the case of mammals, it must not be a predator and it must both chew cud and have [[cloven hooves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rabbi Louis Jacobs |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/kosher-animals/ |title=Kosher Animals |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm |title=Judaism 101: Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hermitage cats''' ({{lang-ru|Эрмитажные коты}}) are a group of [[cats]] residing in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. The museum has a press secretary dedicated to the cats,&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers&gt;Rodgers, James. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7029370.stm Hermitage palace is cat's whiskers]&quot; ([http://www.webcitation.org/6ZiAtzyTB Archive]).

''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 23 May 2013. Retrieved on 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The cats live in the museum's basement, and they also appear on the embankment and on the square during the summer. In previous eras they roamed throughout the museum galleries.&lt;ref name=Natgeo&gt;&quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090612-cats-video-ap.html Cat &quot;Army&quot; Guards Treasures]&quot; ([http://www.webcitation.org/6ZiDyoCnW Archive]). ''[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]''. June 12, 2009. Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 Maria Khaltunen (also &quot;Khaltunin&quot; or &quot;Haltunen&quot;)&lt;!--The &quot;Khaltunin&quot; spelling is from ABC News, &quot;Haltunen&quot; is from ''The New Yorker''--&gt;, who directs the museum's cat programme, stated that there were 60 cats on the museum grounds, even though the staff has a joke that officially the museum is only supposed to have 50 cats.&lt;ref name=Marquardt&gt;Marquardt, Alexander. &quot;[http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/International/russias-hermitage-museum-home-artistic-masters-cats/story?id=11218561 St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum Home to Masters...and Cats]&quot; ([http://www.webcitation.org/6ZiE5oEZQ Archive]). ''[[ABC News]]''. July 30, 2010. Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Irina Popovets, who became the head of the cat department, stated that the cats were &quot;as well-known as our collections.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/the-nine-lives-of-russias-hermitage-museum-cats.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=91288&amp;NewsCatID=378 The nine lives of Russia’s Hermitage Museum cats].&quot; ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' at ''[[Hurriyet Daily News]]''. November 18, 2015. Retrieved on July 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the count had grown to 74 cats, of both sexes (but neutered), according to Haltunen.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;  There are kitchens for preparing their food (&quot;they all have different preferences&quot;), and even a small hospital.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; 

As of 2013 donations, a €400-per-month payment from the charity Pro Animale, and the sponsorship of [[Royal Canin]] fund the presence of the cats.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;

== History ==
The cats were present in the museum, originally a palace, since the 18th century;&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers/&gt; in 1745, [[Elizabeth of Russia]] ordered cats to be placed in the palace in order to control the mice.&lt;ref name=McGrane&gt;McGrane, Sally. &quot;[http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/russias-museum-cats Russia’s Museum Cats]&quot; ([http://www.webcitation.org/6ZiGPBiwT Archive]). ''[[The New Yorker]]''. September 25, 2012. Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; James Rodgers of the [[BBC]] stated that the belief is that the cats originated from [[Kazan]], a city known for having cats good at catching mice. The cats remained in St. Petersburg except during [[World War II]],&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers/&gt; when the existing cat population was killed. A new group of cats replaced the previous cats since the rat population had increased.&lt;ref name=Marquardt/&gt;

In the late 1990s,&lt;!--About 15 years before 2012 is 1997--&gt; Khaltunen began a programme to care for the cats, which previously lived in poor conditions.&lt;ref name=McGrane/&gt;

As of 2007 the museum began adopting cats needing homes.&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers/&gt;  

In 2011, the museum began a &quot;Catfest&quot;, a celebration of its cat population. &quot;Catfest&quot; has included cat painting contests and scavenger hunts for children.&lt;ref name=McGrane/&gt;

Beginning in 2015, because of the number of visiting tourists, a website has been set up by the museum for people who may be interested in adopting a cat. “It is an honor to adopt a Hermitage cat,” one potential cat owner was told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/hermitage-museum-also-serves-as-cat-rescue-adoption-center/|title=Russia’s Hermitage Museum Is Filled With Cats|date=17 November 2015|publisher=''[[The Daily Observer]]''|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unitarian Church Cat Therapy 4.JPG|thumb|right|Therapy cats have cuddled with many hospitals patients, offering comfort and companionship]]

A '''therapy cat''' is a cat trained to help ailing humans in a medically beneficial way to take advantage of the human-animal interaction for purposes of relaxation and healing. A therapy cat provides affection and comfort to people in retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, hospices, and other human service care facilities.

Therapy cats come in all sizes and breeds. The most important characteristic of a therapy cat is its temperament. A good therapy cat must be friendly, patient, confident, gentle, and at ease in all situations. Therapy cats must enjoy human contact and be content to be petted and handled, sometimes clumsily. Cats must demonstrate that loud noises and barking dogs do not bother them.

A therapy cat's primary job is to allow unfamiliar people to make physical contact with it and to enjoy that contact. Children in particular enjoy hugging animals; adults usually enjoy simply petting the cat. The cat might need to be lifted onto, or climb onto, an individual's lap or bed and sit or lie comfortably there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21094">[[Cat]]s hunt small prey, and both [[feral cat|feral]] and [[domestication|domesticated]] cats prey on wildlife. This is sometimes seen as a desirable phenomenon, such as in the case of [[barn cat]]s and other cats kept for the purposes of pest control. In other cases, the effect of cats on wildlife is met with concern.

==Mice and rats==
For thousands of years, cats have been known for their ability to hunt mice and rats and keep their populations under control. This ability is understood as the reason cats became domesticated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple Grandin&quot;&gt;Grandin, Temple and Johnson, Catherine (2009) ''Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best Life for Animals'', Mariner Books, {{ISBN|9780151014897}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|68}} The relationship was more of convenience (or mutualistic) than dependence: &quot;Cats killed mice and rats, and humans provided lots of mice and rats to kill since mice and rats lived in human settlements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple Grandin&quot;/&gt;{{rp|68}} A 2014 study examining 5,300 years of cat remains in an agricultural village of Quanhucun, [[China]], provides early evidence of this dynamic, where cats protected grain stores by eating rodents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient cat bones&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/17/ancient-cat-bone-research-china-domestic-pet | title=Ancient Chinese cat bones shake up domestication theory | newspaper=The Guardian | date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hu 2014 on Cat domestication&quot;&gt;

If they are well-fed, [[farm cat]]s are more dependable as effective ratters, as they are less likely to stray or hunt further afield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabor Wild Life&quot;&gt;Tabor, Roger (1983) ''The Wild Life of the Domestic Cat''.

In 2002, feral cats introduced to a flower market in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], were noted to have helped lower rat populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beverly Hills Rats&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/17/us/up-down-in-and-out-in-beverly-hills-rats.html | title=Up, Down, In and Out in Beverly Hills: Rats | first=Charlie | last=LeDuff | newspaper=The New York Times | date=17 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chicago]]'s 47th Ward, feral cats were introduced in 2012 to help the city deal with the rat problem there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/06/28/north-sides-47th-ward-using-feral-cats-to-catch-rats/ &quot;North Side’s 47th Ward Using Feral Cats To Catch Rats&quot;], CBS Chicago, 28 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Efforts to eradicate feral cats in [[Ventura, California]], were noted in 2002 to have resulted in increasing numbers of rats, which were being monitored for health problems such as [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beverly Hills Rats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA rodents have field day&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/09/local/me-rats9 | title=With the Cats Away, Beachfront Rodents Have a Field Day | first=Jessica | last=Blanchard | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=9 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds==
A 2013 study by Scott R. Loss and others of the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] suggested that free-ranging domestic cats (mostly unowned) are the top human-caused threat to wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loss 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.alleycat.org/document.doc?id=634|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904132317/http://www.alleycat.org/document.doc?id=634|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-04|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=1396|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|pmid=23360987|year=2013|last1=Loss|first1=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='BBCNews'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21236690 | title = Cats killing billions of animals in the US | accessdate = 12 February 2013 | last = Morelle | first = Rebecca | date = 29 January 2013 | work = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were much higher than previous estimates for the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loss 2013&quot;/&gt;{{rp|2}} Unspecified species of birds native to the U.S. and mammals including [[mouse|mice]], [[shrew]]s, [[vole]]s, [[squirrel]]s and [[rabbit]]s were considered most likely to be preyed upon by cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loss 2013&quot;/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Perhaps the first U.S. study that pointed to predation by cats on wildlife as a concern was ornithologist [[Edward Howe Forbush]]'s 1916 report for the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, ''The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife: Means of Utilizing and Controlling It''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Howe Forbush, [https://archive.org/details/domesticcatbirdk00forbrich &quot;The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife: Means of Utilizing and Controlling It&quot;], Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State Board of Agriculture, Economic Biology Bulletin 42, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.K. biologist and cat behaviour expert Roger Tabor states that &quot;studies from all around the world have found that cats catch relatively few birds compared to small mammals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabor Cat Behavior&quot;&gt;Tabor, Roger (2003) ''Understanding Cat Behavior''. David &amp; Charles Ltd. {{ISBN|9780715315897}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] states that there is no scientific evidence that cat predation &quot;is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Are cats causing bird declines?&quot;&gt;
[http://www.rspb.org.uk/advice/gardening/unwantedvisitors/cats/birddeclines.aspx &quot;Are cats causing bird declines?&quot;] The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, accessed 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, city cats have smaller ranges. In his research, Tabor found &quot;the average annual catch of the average London cat to be two items instead of the fourteen of a village cat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabor Cat Behavior&quot;/&gt;{{rp|135}} Tabor comments about some of the challenges of stalking birds for cats: &quot;From the cat's point of view not only do birds not play fair by flying and having eyes that can see beyond the back of their heads, but they can positively cheat by using loud alarm calls and throw the cat's chances of catching any others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabor Wild Life&quot;/&gt;{{rp|123}}

Island settings pose particular challenges for wildlife. A 2001 study identified cats alone as responsible for the plight of some island bird species, such as the [[Townsend's shearwater]], [[socorro dove]], and the [[Marquesan ground dove]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Endangered birds&quot;&gt;

==Impact by location==

===Australia===
{{See also|Cats in Australia}}

Cats in Australia have been found to have European origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Population Origins and Expansion of Feral Cats in Australia|last = Spencer|first = Peter B.S.|date = 9 November 2015|journal = American Genetic Association|doi = 10.1093/jhered/esv095|volume=107|pages=104–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is important to note because of their effect on native species. Feral cats in Australia have been linked to the decline and extinction of various native animals. They have been shown to cause a significant impact on ground nesting birds and small native mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Dickman|first1 = Chris|title = Overview of the Impacts of Feral Cats on Australian Native Fauna|publisher = The Director of National Parks and Wildlife&amp;nbsp;– Australian Nature Conservation Agency&amp;nbsp;– Institute of Wildlife Research|date = May 1996|url = http://secure.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|accessdate = 11 February 2013|isbn = 0-642-21379-8|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040904/http://secure.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feral cats have also hampered any attempts to re-introduce threatened species back into areas where they have become extinct as the cats have hunted and killed the newly released animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/pestsweeds/TheThreatOfFeralCats.htm The Threat Of FeralCats]. Environment.nsw.gov.au (28 October 2011). Retrieved on 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Australian environmentalists claim the feral cat has been an ecological disaster in Australia, inhabiting most ecosystems except dense [[rainforest]], and being implicated in the [[extinction]] of several [[marsupial]] and [[Placentalia|placental]] mammal [[species]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Interactions&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Interactions between feral cats, foxes, native carnivores, and rabbits in Australia | journal = CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems / Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research | date = Sep 2004 | authors = Robley, A.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Cats in New Zealand}}

The fauna of [[New Zealand]] has evolved in isolation for millions of years without the presence of mammals (apart from a few bat species). Consequently, birds dominated the niches occupied by mammals and many became flightless. The introduction of mammals after settlement by [[Māori people|Māori]] from about the 12th century had a huge effect on the indigenous [[biodiversity]]. [[Europe]]an explorers and settlers brought cats on their ships and the presence of feral cats were recorded from the latter decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;King, Carolyn (1984) ''Immigrant Killers''. Auckland: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-558121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is estimated that feral cats have been responsible for the extinction of six endemic bird species and over 70 localised subspecies as well as depleting bird and lizard species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | authors = Eason, Charles T.; Morgan, David R. and Clapperton, B.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] states that there is no scientific evidence that cat predation &quot;is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide. The article goes on to say, &quot;This may be surprising, but many millions of birds die naturally every year, mainly through starvation, disease, or other forms of predation. There is evidence that cats tend to take weak or sickly birds&quot;.

&quot;Those bird species that have undergone the most serious population declines in the UK (such as [[Alauda|skylarks]], [[Eurasian tree sparrow|tree sparrows]] and [[corn bunting]]s) rarely encounter cats, so cats cannot be causing their declines. Research shows that these declines are usually caused by habitat change or loss, particularly on farmland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Are cats causing bird declines?&quot;/&gt; This evidence is despite the common practice in the U.K. of allowing owned cats access to the outdoors,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the UK, the vast majority of pet cats have free access to the outside world, or are at least allowed to go outside unsupervised for large parts of the day.&quot; [http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/pet-advice/a-world-of-difference-how-cat-ownership-in-america-differs-to-the-uk.html &quot;A world of difference – How cat ownership in America differs to the UK&quot;], Pets4Homes, accessed 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which is recommended to prevent feline obesity (p.&amp;nbsp;138) and behavior problems and other health problems arising from confinement stress (p.&amp;nbsp;121).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabor Cat Behavior&quot;/&gt;

[[SongBird Survival]] considers that &quot;The prevailing line that “there is no scientific evidence that predation by cats is having any impact on bird populations in UK” is simply no longer tenable.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.songbird-survival.org.uk/cats.html&lt;/ref&gt; noting &quot;No study has ever examined the impact of cats on songbirds at the population level; Evidence shows that the recovering sparrowhawk population in the 1970-80s resulted in the decline of some songbird populations; Cats kill around 3 times as many songbirds as sparrowhawks; The mere presence of cats near birds’ nests was found to decrease provision of food by a third while the resultant mobbing clamour from parent birds led in turn to increased nest predation by crows and magpies; [and that] It is therefore far more likely that cats have an even greater impact on songbird populations than sparrowhawks&quot;

[[Sir David Attenborough]] in his Christmas Day edition of [[BBC Radio 4]] programme Tweet Of The Day said &quot;&quot;Cats kill an extraordinarily high number of birds in British gardens,&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/cats-killing-birds-gardens-david-attenborough&lt;/ref&gt; Asked whether cat owners should buy bell collars for their pets at Christmas, he replied: &quot;That would be good for the robins, yes.&quot;

===Islands===

====Consequences of introduction====
[[File:Xenicus lyalli.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lyall's wren]] became extinct within two years of the introduction of cats to [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]].]]

Many islands host [[island tameness|ecologically naive]] animal species. That is, animals that do not have predator responses for dealing with predators such as cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moors&quot;&gt;Moors, P.J.; Atkinson, I.A.E. (1984). &quot;Predation on seabirds by introduced animals, and factors affecting its severity&quot; in ''Status and Conservation of the World's Seabirds''. Cambridge: ICBP. {{ISBN|0-946888-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Feral cats [[introduced species|introduced]] to such islands have had a devastating impact on these islands' [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

They have been implicated in the extinction of several species and local extinctions, such as the [[hutia]]s from the [[Caribbean]], the [[Guadalupe storm petrel]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]], and [[Lyall's wren]]. In a statistical study, they were a significant cause for the extinction of 40% of the species studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/magazine/02cats-v--birds-t.html?em&amp;ex=1196830800&amp;en=4328122ab745ee4d&amp;ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=Kill the Cat That Kills the Bird? | first=Bruce | last=Barcott | date=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moors and Atkinson wrote, in 1984, &quot;No other alien predator has had such a universally damaging effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moors&quot;/&gt;

Feral cats, along with rabbits, some sea birds, and [[sheep]], form the entire large animal population of the remote [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. Although exotic mammals form the bulk of their diet, cats' impact on seabirds is very important.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerguelen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00300-002-0424-5 | title=The diet of feral cats (''Felis catus'' L.) at ﬁve sites on the Grande Terre, Kerguelen archipelago | author=Pontier, D., L.

====Restoration====
Because of the damage cats cause in islands and some ecosystems, many conservationists working in the field of [[island restoration]] have worked to remove feral cats. (Island restoration involves the removal of introduced species and reintroducing native species.) As of 2004, 48 islands have had their feral cat populations eradicated, including [[New Zealand]]'s network of offshore island bird reserves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.issg.org/pdf/publications/Island_Invasives/pdfHQprint/1Campbell.pdf|title=A review of feral cat eradication on islands|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00442.x|year=2004|last1=Nogales|first1=Manuel|last2=Martin|first2=Aurelio|last3=Tershy|first3=Bernie R.|last4=Donlan|first4=C.

Larger projects have also been undertaken, including their complete removal from [[Ascension Island]]. The cats, introduced in the 19th century, caused a collapse in populations of nesting [[seabird]]s. The project to remove them from the island began in 2002, and the island was cleared of cats by 2004. Since then, seven species of seabird that had not nested on the island for 100 years have returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petsaspests.blogspot.com/search?q=ascension Cat eradication from Ascension Island]. Petsaspests.blogspot.com (2014-01-23). Retrieved on 2015-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15228">The '''cat gap''' is a period in the [[fossil record]] of approximately [[Miocene|25 to 18.5 million years ago]] in which there are few fossils of [[Feliformia|cats or cat-like species]] found in [[North America]]. The cause of the &quot;cat gap&quot; is disputed, but may have been caused by changes in the climate ([[global cooling]]), changes in the habitat and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] [[ecosystem]], the increasingly [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] trend of the cats (especially the [[nimravids]]), [[volcanic activity]], [[evolution]]ary changes in [[Tooth|dental]] [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[Canidae]] species present in North America, or a periodicity of extinctions called [[Extinction event#Patterns in frequency|van der Hammen cycles]].&lt;ref name=Meehan&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T.

==Cat evolution==
[[File:Feliform Timeline.svg|right|300px|thumbnail|Feliform evolutionary timeline]]

All modern [[carnivora]]ns, including cats, evolved from [[Miacoidea|miacoids]], which existed from approximately 66 to 33 million years ago. There were other earlier cat-like species but ''[[Proailurus]]'' (meaning &quot;before the cat&quot;; also called &quot;Leman's Dawn Cat&quot;), which appeared about 30&amp;nbsp;million years ago, is generally considered the first &quot;true cat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Cats of Africa: Behaviour, Ecology, and Conservation |last=Hunter |first=Luke |authorlink= |author2=Hinde, Gerald |year=2005 |publisher=Struik |location=Cape Town |isbn=1-77007-063-X |pages=40–42 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Cquote|Following the appearance of the dawn cat, there is little in the fossil record for 10 million years to suggest that cats would prosper. In fact, although ''Proailurus'' persisted for at least 14&amp;nbsp;million years, there are so few felid fossils towards the end of the dawn cat's reign that paleontologists refer to this as the &quot;cat gap&quot;. The turning point for cats came about with the appearance of a new genus of felids, ''[[Pseudaelurus]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;}}

The increase in disparity through the early Miocene occurs during a time when few feliform fossils have been found in North America. The hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 Ma and felids did not arrive in North America until the [[Middle Miocene]] with the appearance of ''Pseudaelurus''. ''Pseudaelurus'' crossed over to North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]] from surviving populations in [[Asia]] 18.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. All modern-day cats are descended from ''Pseudaelurus''.

Nimravids and barbourofelids were [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed cat-like]] animals of the families [[Nimravidae]] and [[Barbourofelidae]], respectively. Although not &quot;true cats&quot; of the family [[Felidae]], they are closely related to felids. The Nimravidae are either basal feliforms or sister group to both feliforms and caniforms, while the [[Barbourofelidae]] are sister group to the Felidae. Physically, some Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae resembled the saber-toothed cat ''[[Smilodon]]'', which would not appear until many millions of years later. Nimravidae also became extinct in North America during the &quot;cat gap.&quot;&lt;ref name=Joeckela&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. M. Joeckel |author2=Stephane Peigneb |author3=Robert M.

==Possible causes==

===Hypercarnivorous tendency===
The history of carnivorous mammals is characterized by a series of rise-and-fall patterns of diversification in which declining [[clades]] are replaced by [[phylogenetic]]ally distinct but functionally similar clades. Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of small and large carnivorous mammals diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the decline was energetic constraints and pervasive selection for larger size ([[Cope's rule]]) that lead to [[hypercarnivory]] dietary specialization. Hypercarnivory leads to increased vulnerability to extinction.

The [[nimravid]]s were large cat-like animals that occupied this ecomorphic niche in the [[ecosystem]] until 26 Ma. It is highly likely that their hypercarnivory led to their extinction in North America. After the extinction of the nimravids there were no other feliform or [[Felidae|felid]]-like species until other felids arrived from Eurasia after crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] 18.5 million years ago. During this time there was great diversity among the other carnivorous mammals in North America – both hypocarnivorous and hypercarnivorous species – and other hypercarnivorous species existed before, during, and after the cat gap.

===Changes in climate and habitat===
[[File:Leopard on the tree.jpg|right|thumbnail|Many cats tend to be [[arboreal]] hunters. The disappearance of forests in North America may have caused the mass extinction.]]

Another possible explanation for the extinction of feliforms in North America is [[Ecological succession|changes in the ecology]] of the continent. Evidence from the [[geologic temperature record]] shows that the earth was experiencing a period of [[global cooling]], causing [[forest]]s to give way to [[savanna]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Climatic changes to arid conditions that muted variation at about 25.8 Ma coincides with the first appearance of hoglike [[creodont]]s and of pocket gophers, and this also is the beginning of the &quot;cat gap&quot; and the &quot;[[entelodont]] gap&quot;, a period of some 7 million years when there were no nimravids, felids, or entelodonts in North America. [[Fauna]]l overturn at 25.8 Ma is the basis for division of the [[Miocene|Arikareean]] time period (30.5–19 Ma), and the Arikareen NALMA (North American Land-Mammal Ages), into the [[Monroecreekian]] period (29.5–25.8 Ma), and then the [[Harrisonian]] period (25.8–23.5 Ma).&lt;ref name=Retallack&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gregory J.

{{Cquote|Why did these cat-like creatures die out in North America (while surviving in Eurasia) with no replacement by the true cats? Their fate may be owed to the same factors that created the diversity of herbivorous mammals, for most cats need forest or cover from which to hunt. In an increasingly open America the nimravids may have found themselves without an ecological perch to hunt from, particularly if the competition with dogs prevented them from colonising the savannas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flannery&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples |last=Flannery |first=Tim |year=2002 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3888-8 |pages=113–114 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other===
Volcanic activity has also been promoted as a possible cause of the cat gap as well as other extinctions during this time period. The [[La Garita Caldera]] is a large volcanic [[caldera]] located in the [[San Juan Mountains]] in southwestern [[Colorado]], United States, and is one of a number of calderas that formed during a massive [[ignimbrite]] flare-up in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada during the [[Oligocene]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|Epoch]]. The La Garita Caldera was the site of the [[Fish Canyon eruption]], an enormous eruption about 27 million years ago. The scale of the Fish Canyon eruption was far beyond anything known in human history (erupting more than {{convert|10000|km3|cumi|abbr=on|disp=or}} for a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 8+ magnitude), and was possibly the most energetic event on Earth since the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact]], which is thought by many paleontologists to have caused the [[extinction]] of the [[dinosaurs]] in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The resulting explosive volcanism probably ejected large amounts of dust and debris into the [[stratosphere]] causing major cooling (see [[volcanic winter]]). Climatic effects could also have been caused by [[sulphur]] ejected into the [[stratosphere]], which rapidly converts to [[sulphuric acid]], an [[aerosol]] which cools the [[troposphere]] by blocking incoming [[solar radiation]].

Another possible cause of the cat gap could have been the late Cenozoic [[Timeline of glaciation|ice age]] that began approximately 30 million years ago. This ice age caused [[glaciation]] in [[Antarctica]] that eventually spread to [[Arctic]] regions of southern [[Alaska]], [[Greenland]], and [[Iceland]]. Glaciers on the North American continent, as well as the cooling trend, could have made the ecosystem uninhabitable for feliformia cat-like species, although habitable for cold-weather [[caniformia]] species such as [[canids]] (dog-like species), [[mustelids]] (weasel-like species), and [[ursids]] (bear-like species).

{{Cquote|There is also evidence that during the Miocene a sill surrounding the Arctic Ocean, known as the Greenland–Scotland Ridge, subsided, allowing more cold polar water to escape into the North Atlantic. As the salinity of the North Atlantic grew and as outflow of cold polar water increased, so the [[thermohaline circulation]] increased in vigour, providing the mild winter temperatures and large amounts of moisture to the North Atlantic, which are prerequisites to the build-up of the large continental ice caps on the adjacent cold continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haggart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ice-age Theories |title=The Oxford Companion to the Earth |last=Haggart |first=B. A. |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn= |pages= |chapterurl=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O112-iceagetheories.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Evolution of caniforms during the gap==
[[File:Amphicyonidae_illustration.png|right|thumbnail|Some paleontologists argue that caniforms like [[Amphicyonidae]] - &quot;bear dogs&quot; - responded to the cat gap by evolving to become more cat-like, to fill the [[hypercarnivore]] [[ecological niche]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Valkenburgh&quot;/&gt;]]

It has been suggested by some that as a result of the cat gap [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (dog-like species including canids, bears, weasels, and other related taxa) evolved to fill more carnivorous and [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] [[ecological niche]]s that would otherwise have been filled by cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valkenburgh&quot;/&gt; This conclusion, however, is disputed.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gina D. Wesley-Hunt | year = 2005 | title = The morphological diversification of carnivores in North America | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–55 | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/120516/the_morphological_diversification_of_carnivores_in_north_america/index.html | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031&lt;0035:TMDOCI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=2008-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|During or just prior to this &quot;cat gap,&quot; numerous caniform species evolve catlike features indicative of hypercarnivory, such as reduced snouts, somewhat enlarged canines, and fairly extreme reduction of their crushing [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s. In North America the first caniform group of moderate body size to move in the direction of hypercarnivory were the [[endemic]] [[Hesperocyoninae|hesperocyonine]] canids, with three genera (''[[Parenhydrocyon]]'', ''[[Enhydrocyon]]'', and ''[[Mesocyon]]''), ranging in size from jackals to small coyotes, appearing in the early [[Arikareean]] (circa 28 MYA). Notably, these three evolved alongside the last [[hyaenodont]] and the remaining three nimravids, two of which were [[Cougar|puma]]-sized. The small hypercarnivorous canids were soon joined by and ultimately replaced by numerous species from other families which also had evolved more specialized meat-eating teeth and skulls. These included at least three larger genera of similarly adapted [[amphicyonid]]s, one endemic (''[[Daphoenodon]]'') and two from the Old World (''[[Temnocyon]]'' and ''[[Mammocyon]]''), a leopard-sized [[Mustelidae|mustelid]] (''[[Megalictis]]'') as well as two hypercarnivorous bears, the [[hemicyonine]]s ''[[Cephalogale]]'' and ''[[Phoberocyon]]''.&lt;ref name=Valkenburgh&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Valkenburgh |first=Blaire |year=1999 |title=Major Patterns in the History of Carnivorous Mammals |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=463–493 | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463?journalCode=earth |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463 | accessdate=2008-11-28 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, other paleontologists take issue with this conclusions:

{{Cquote|It has been suggested that canids evolved hypercarnivorous morphologies because feliforms were absent during this period (the ‘cat-gap’’, 26–16 Ma). The data presented here do not support this hypothesis. In the calculated [[morphospace]]... Canids never occupy the area of morphospace in which felids, nimravids, and hypercarnivorous [[creodont]]s are found. More pertinent to the issue at hand, however, is that most of these hypercarnivorous canids were present before the disappearance of the nimravids, and all became extinct before the appearance of felids....There was a progressive and marked decrease in hypercarnivorous forms during the ‘‘cat-gap.’’ 28–20 Ma are characterized by above average extinction intensities and below average origination intensities. 20 Ma was marked by an increase in origination intensity, and 18 Ma showed a decrease in extinction intensity and a large increase in origination intensity. Nonetheless, despite increased origination intensities and decreased extinction intensities near the end of the ‘‘cat-gap’’ (20–16 Ma), there was still no substantial invasion of hypercarnivorous morphospace until the immigration of felids into North America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt&quot; /&gt;}}

{{merge to|Felidae|discuss=Talk:Felidae#Merger proposal|date=September 2016}}A '''pet exotic feline''', also called '''pet wild cat''' or '''pet non-domestic cat''', is a member of the [[Felidae]] family (excluding the [[Cat|house cat]] and hybrids thereof) kept as an [[exotic pet]].

== Definition and differentiations ==
Hybrids of the domestic cat with non-domestic species (e. g. the [[Bengal cat]] or the [[Savannah cat]]) are not normally considered '''wild cats'''. While this distinction is often overlooked in the media and in the public eye, such cat breeds (especially the F5 and subsequent generations) are much closer to the domestic cat in terms of housing and husbandry requirements, behavior, and legality.

Unlike many other exotic pet species, wild cats usually cannot be kept indoors and require a large outdoor enclosure. This blurs the distinction between a wild cat being kept as an exotic pet and a private animal collection or menagerie. Usually, an enclosure meant for a pet exotic cat is built adjacent to the house in order to give the animal access into the living quarters.

[[Lion taming|Tame big cats]] kept by [[Animal training|animal trainers]] (e. g. in circuses, private zoos or the film animal industry) are commonly mistaken for exotic pets. While the husbandry conditions and handling might be similar to a purely private setting, the common definition of a [[pet]] only includes animals kept for companionship or pleasure. Professional holders, breeders, or exhibitors do not meet this definition.

== History ==
Exotic felines have a long tradition in human care. The ancient Egyptians kept servals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesticatedservals.com/|title=Domesticated Servals|website=www.domesticatedservals.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same role as the African Wildcat (the wild ancestor of modern house cats). [[Cheetah]]s have also been kept throughout the world, both as companions and as hunting aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cheetahs-rock.de/index-englisch.htm|title=Cheetah's Rock|website=www.cheetahs-rock.de|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caracals have also been tamed and trained, primarily by Arabian and Asian rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caracal-rock.com/index-englisch.htm|title=Caracal Rock|website=www.caracal-rock.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large cats sometimes were also kept as companions, but were mostly limited to menageries owned by royal families.

== Species kept as exotic pets ==
In general, small cat species are more commonly kept as exotic pets than larger ones. [[Big cat]]s are substantially more expensive to maintain, pose a greater danger when being handled in direct contact, and may not always remain handleable when fully grown. This typically limits their keeping to professional animal trainers and zoo settings.

=== Servals and caracals ===
[[Serval]]s and [[caracal]]s have the longest history as human companions. Part of their popularity can be attributed to the fact that they readily hybridize with domestic cats. The resulting crosses ([[Savannah cat|savannahs]] and caracats) inherit traits of both the domestic cat and the wild species. &lt;ref&gt; https://caracats.wordpress.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lynxes and bobcats ===
Nearly all species of the [[Lynx]] genus (with the exception of the Iberian lynx) are kept as exotic pets. Unlike other small cat species, they are not known to hybridize with the domestic cat.

=== Ocelots ===
This species enjoyed some popularity as an exotic pet in the 50s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://allaboutocelots.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/ocelots-as-pets/|title=Ocelots as pets|date=2015-12-25|website=all about ocelots|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Endangered Species Act in the USA effectively ended their keeping outside of zoological facilities due to interstate animal movement restrictions. Their popularity is also limited by their comparatively high aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phoenixexotics.org/caresheet/ocelot|title=Care Sheet - Ocelot {{!}} Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association|website=www.phoenixexotics.org|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; No hybrids with domestic cats are known.

=== Pumas ===
While being considered small cats taxonomically, pumas are comparable in size to some of the big cats. They are typically less aggressive and more affectionate than big cats, which has led to some popularity as exotic pets.

=== Cheetahs ===
The cheetah has a long history as a human companion. However, difficulties in breeding prevented this species from becoming a widespread exotic pet in modern times.

[[File:CatVibrissaeFullFace.JPG|thumb|The large ears, eyes, and many vibrissae of the cat adapt it for low-light predation]]
'''Cat senses''' are [[adaptation]]s that allow [[cat]]s to be highly efficient [[predator]]s. Cats have acute sight, hearing and smell, and their sense of touch is enhanced by long whiskers that protrude from their heads and bodies. These senses allow cats to hunt effectively in dim light and at night.

==Sight==
[[Image:Reflektion des Auges.JPG|thumb|left|The tapetum lucidum reflecting green in the pupils of a cat]]
Cats, like dogs and many other animals, have a ''[[tapetum lucidum]]'', which is a reflective layer behind the [[retina]] that sends light that passes through the retina back into the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braekevelt CR |title=Fine structure of the feline tapetum lucidum |journal=Anat Histol Embryol |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=97–105 |year=1990 |pmid=2240589 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0264.1990.tb00892.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this improves the ability to see in darkness, it appears to reduce net [[visual acuity]], thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like [[pupil]] closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive [[retina]], and improving [[depth of field]]. [[Big cat]]s have pupils that contract to a round point. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in color of cats' eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the reflection of the flash by the tapetum.
[[Image:Cats Eye 004.jpg|200px|thumb|A closeup of a cat's eye]]
Cats have a visual [[field of view]] of  200° compared with 180° in humans, but a binocular field (overlap in the images from each eye) narrower than that of humans. As with most predators, their eyes face forward, affording [[depth perception]] at the expense of field of view. Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye's construction. Instead of the [[Optic fovea|fovea]], which gives humans sharp central vision, cats have a central band known as the visual streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes A |title=A quantitative analysis of the cat retinal ganglion cell topography |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=107–28 |year=1975 |pmid=1159109 |doi=10.1002/cne.901630107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats can see some [[color]]s, and can tell the difference between red, blue and yellow lights, as well as between red and green lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Guenther |first=Elke |last2=Zrenner |first2=Eberhart |title=The Spectral Sensitivity of Dark- and Light-adapted Cat Retinal Ganglion Cells |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=13 |pages=1543–1550 |date=April 1993 |url= http://www.jneurosci.org/content/13/4/1543.full.pdf+html |issue=4 |pmid=8463834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are able to distinguish between blues and violets better than between colors near the red end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kittyshow.com/cat_color_vision.html Cat Vision and How Cats See&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study found that, along with several other mammals, cats [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]es transmit significant amounts of [[ultraviolet]] (UVA 315–400&amp;nbsp;nm) light, which suggests that they possess sensitivity to this part of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/43461-cats-and-dogs-see-in-ultraviolet.html|title=Cats and Dogs May See in Ultraviolet|work=LiveScience.com|author= Lewis, Tanya|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2013.2995|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1780/20132995|title=The spectral transmission of ocular media suggests ultraviolet sensitivity is widespread among mammals|publisher=Royal Society Publishing: Proceedings B|date=19 February 2014|author1=R. H. Douglas |author2=G. Jeffery }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats have a second eyelid, the [[nictitating membrane]], which is a thin cover that closes from the side and appears when the cat's eyelid opens. This membrane partially closes if the cat is sick, although in a sleepy state this membrane is often visible.

Cats struggle to see still water, and will often disrupt the surface with their paws or lick water off their paws.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Cats often sleep during the day so they can &quot;hunt&quot; at night. Unlike humans, cats do not need to [[blink]] their eyes on a regular basis to keep their eyes lubricated (with [[tears]]). Unblinking eyes are probably an advantage when hunting. Cats will, however, &quot;squint&quot; their eyes, usually as a form of communication expressing affection and ease around another cat or human.&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd cats&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/cat-body-language|title=What Your Cat's Body Language Is Saying|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Two eyes cat.jpg|thumb|A white kitten with [[heterochromia|heterochromatic]] eyes.]]

==Hearing==
Humans and cats have a similar range of hearing on the low end of the scale, but cats can hear much higher-pitched sounds, up to 64 [[Hertz|kHz]], which is 1.6 octaves above the range of a human, and even 1 octave above the range of a dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsu.edu/deafness/HearingRange.html|title=Frequency Hearing Ranges in Dogs and Other Species|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When listening for something, a cat's ears will swivel in that direction; a cat's ear flaps ([[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]]) can independently point backwards as well as forwards and sideways to pinpoint the source of the [[sound]]. Cats can judge within {{convert|3|in|spell=in}} the location of a sound being made {{convert|1|yd|cm|spell=in}} away{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}—this can be useful for locating their prey.

Although it was long generally thought that cats were unresponsive to music, recent studies have shown that they do in fact respond to music which has been created with species-specific frequencies. Results suggested that cats do benefit from music therapy when the sounds have been composed to target their auditory senses. Other findings include age-related sensitivity (older and younger cats were more responsive than middle aged cats).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Teie|first2=David|last3=Savage|first3=Megan|date=2015-05-01|title=Cats prefer species-appropriate music|url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(15)00060-X/fulltext|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|language=English|volume=166|pages=106–111|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.02.012|issn=0168-1591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that all white cats with blue eyes are deaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beadle1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Muriel Beadle|title=Cat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tnjgqpNKYksC&amp;pg=PA164|date=29 October 1979|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-25190-1|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not true, as there are many blue-eyed cats with perfect hearing. However, white cats with blue eyes do have slightly higher incidences of genetic deafness than white cats of other eye colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geigy CA, Heid S, Steffen F, Danielson K, Jaggy A, Gaillard C |title=Does a pleiotropic gene explain deafness and blue irises in white cats? |journal=Vet. J. |volume=173 |issue=3 |pages=548–53 |year=2007 |pmid=16956778 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090-0233(06)00169-9 |doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.07.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; White cats having one blue and one other-colored eye are called &quot;[[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]]&quot; and may be deaf on the same side as the blue eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.messybeast.com/whitecat.htm |title=White Cats, Eye Colours and Deafness |last=Hartwell |first=Sarah|accessdate=5 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the result of the yellow iris pigmentation rising to the surface of only one eye, as blue eyes are normal at birth before the adult pigmentation has had a chance to express itself in the eye(s).

==Smell==
A domestic cat's [[olfaction|sense of smell]] is about fourteen times as strong as humans'.{{dubious|About.com source on cat/human olfactory comparison|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name=&quot;sense of smell&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cats.about.com/cs/felineanatomy/a/catsnose_scent.htm | title=The Nose Knows | publisher=About.com | accessdate=29 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats have twice as many receptors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=Dale|last2=Augustine|first2=George J.|last3=Fitzpatrick|first3=David|last4=Hall|first4=William C.|last5=LaMantia|first5=Anthony-Samuel|last6=White|first6=Leonard E.|title=Neuroscience|date=2001-01-15|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=9780878937424|edition=2nd|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11032/|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[olfactory epithelium]] (i.e. smell-sensitive cells in their noses) as people do, meaning that cats have a more acute sense of smell than humans. Cats also have a scent organ in the roof of their mouths called the [[vomeronasal organ|vomeronasal]] (or Jacobson's) organ. When a cat wrinkles its muzzle, lowers its chin, and lets its tongue hang a bit, it is opening the passage to the vomeronasal. This is called ''gaping'', &quot;sneering&quot;, &quot;snake mouth&quot;, or &quot;flehming&quot;. Gaping is the equivalent of the [[Flehmen response]] in other animals, such as [[dog]]s, [[horse]]s and [[big cat]]s.

==Touch==
[[Image:Tuxedo kitten.jpg|thumb|Whiskers on the face of a [[Bicolor cat#Tuxedo cats|tuxedo kitten]].]]

A cat has about twenty-four movable [[vibrissae]] (&quot;whiskers&quot;), in four sets on each upper lip on either side of its nose (some cats may have more). There are also a few on each cheek, tufts over the eyes, bristles on the chin, the cat's inner &quot;wrists&quot;, and at the back of the legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moggies.co.uk/html/whiskers.html|title=Cat's Whiskers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sphynx (cat)|Sphynx]] (a nearly hairless breed) may have full length, short, or no whiskers at all.

The structure of the brain region ([[barrel cortex]]) which receives information from the vibrissae is similar to that found in the [[visual cortex]] which permits the cat to create a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] map of its surroundings. This doesn't mean that sensing with vibrissae is a type of vision. It is still a touch sensation and environmental information is built up incrementally (in small steps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dykes RW, Dudar JD, Tanji DG, Publicover NG |title=Somatotopic projections of mystacial vibrissae on cerebral cortex of cats |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=997–1014 |date=September 1977 |pmid=903802 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=903802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gottschaldt KM, Young DW |title=Properties of different functional types of neurones in the cat's rostral trigeminal nuclei responding to sinus hair stimulation |journal=J.

Vibrissae aid sensation and [[navigation]]. The upper two rows of whiskers are able to be moved independently from the lower two rows for greater [[accuracy and precision|precision]] during measurement. A cat's whiskers are more than twice as thick as ordinary cat hairs, and their roots are three times deeper in a cat's tissue than other hairs. They have numerous [[nerve]] endings at their base, which give cats extraordinarily detailed information about nearby air movements and objects with which they make physical contact. They enable a cat to know that it is near obstacles without it needing to see them.

Whiskers also aid in hunting. [[High speed photography]] reveals that when a cat is unable to see its prey because it is too close to its mouth, its whiskers move so as to form a basket shape around its [[snout|muzzle]] in order to precisely detect the prey's location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridaconservation.org/panther/handbook/natural/relation.html Cat Traits] Floridaconservation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mel Sunquist |author2=Sunquist, Fiona |author3=Sunquist, Melvin E. |title=Wild cats of the world |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-77999-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat whose whiskers have been damaged may bite the wrong part of its prey, indicating that they provide cats with detailed information about the shape and activity of its prey.[[Image:DSC 0003 - Version 3.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Whiskers also aid in hunting]]

==Taste==
The [[Felidae|cat family]] was shown in 2005 to lack the [[TAS1R2]] [[protein]], one of two required for function of the [[sweetness]] [[sensory receptor]]; a [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]] in the relevant [[gene]] (''Tas1r2'') causes a shift in the genetic [[reading frame]], leading to [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stopping early and no detectable [[mRNA]] or protein produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li X |title=Pseudogenization of a Sweet-Receptor Gene Accounts for Cats' Indifference toward Sugar |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=27–35 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16103917 |pmc=1183522 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010003 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010003 |author2=Li W |author3=Wang H |display-authors=3 |last4=Cao |first4=Jie |last5=Maehashi |first5=Kenji |last6=Huang |first6=Liquan |last7=Bachmanov |first7=Alexander A. |last8=Reed |first8=Danielle R. |last9=Legrand-Defretin |first9=Véronique}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other protein, [[T1R3|TAS1R3]], is present and identical to that of other animals, and the relevant [[taste bud]]s are still present but inactive. Such a [[genetic marker]] found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a [[mutation]] in an early ancestor; as a [[deletion mutation]] it could not [[Evolutionary biology|revert]], and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the [[evolutionary tree]] branched out. Some scientists now believe this is the root of the cat family's extremely specialized [[evolution]]ary [[ecological niche|niche]] as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.

[[Image:Neighbours Siamese.jpg|thumb|A cat with a point coloration.]]
'''Point coloration''' refers to animal coat coloration with a pale body and relatively darker extremities, i.e. the face, ears, feet, tail, and (in males) [[scrotum]]. It is most recognized as the coloration of [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] and related breeds of [[cat]], but can be found in [[rabbit]]s, [[fancy rat|rats]], [[sheep]], and [[horse]]s as well.

[[File:PhaithaiChic Thai cat.jpg|thumb|A [[Thai cat]] with point coloration]]
Point coloration in cats originated in the [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] and closely related Asian breeds, and is found in many Western-developed modern breeds. It is a form of partial [[albinism]] resulting from a [[mutation]] that affects [[tyrosinase]], an enzyme involved with [[melanin]] production. The mutated enzyme is [[thermolabile]]; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler areas of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Pointed [[kitten]]s are born white, since the womb is uniformly warm. As the kitten ages, the cooler areas darken while warmer areas remain cream to white in color. Points are not limited to solid colors or dark colors. It is possible to have a red (orange color) or fawn (pale warm gray) point. It is also possible to have a [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] or [[tabby]] point. This coloration is also sometimes called ''colorpoints''.

As the expression of the gene responsible for the pointed pattern is regulated by temperature, pointed cats who live in cooler environments often show darkening of their fur, with large patches along their sides sometimes developing.

Because of this restriction of pigment, pointed cat's eyes are always some shade of blue, because the top layer of the iris is not covered in another color, letting the blue show through. The back of the eye also lacks pigment, giving these cats' pupils an eerie red reflection in the dark, unlike a normally pigmented cat's green to blue shine.

The [[Cat coat genetics|point gene]] is carried on the C [[Locus (genetics)|locus]], where pure [[albinism]] is also carried. It is shown with the sign '''cs''', and needs two alleles of cs for the points to be expressed. Also carried on the C locus is the gene for the [[sepia pattern]]. This is the darkest of all of the pigment restricting patterns, and pigment is only paled at the warmest point in the body, the abdomen. This pattern's gene is represented by '''cb'''. When a cat carries the genes cs and cb, the [[mink pattern]] is formed, in which the pigment distribution is between a sepia and a point cat.

{{anchor|Lynx point|lynx point|lynx point (coloration)}}
The ''lynx point'' pattern is formed by cross-breeding a colorpoint cat with a [[tabby cat]] (or breeding cats that already possess the lynx point pattern). It is characterized by a mixture of the darkening (reduced) of point coloration, with distinct tabby striping on the head, tail, and legs, and an otherwise uniform and comparatively pale body. It is an accepted pattern, in some cat registries but not others, for particular breeds, mostly Siamese-related.&lt;ref&gt;Exactly which registries accept lynx-point coloration, or other point coloration, at any given time is a moving target, best checked with awards searches at particular registries, e.g. a [http://www.tica.org/search?searchword=lynx%20point&amp;ordering=newest&amp;searchphrase=all&amp;limit=20 search for &quot;lynx point&quot; at the TICA website].&lt;/ref&gt; Lynx point coloration was also a feature of some of the [[foundation stock]] of the [[Siberian cat|Siberian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tica.org/find-a-breeder/item/269-siberian-introduction|title=Siberian Introduction|first=|last=TICA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In horses==
{{main|bay (horse)}}
[[File:Trotting Belgian draft horse.jpg|thumb|A bay horse, showing black points.]]
[[File:He012002 1.jpg|thumb|left|White markings or other genetic factors may partially or completely mask point coloration in horses.]]
In horses, point coloration is produced by the action of the [[Agouti signalling peptide|Agouti]] gene, which acts on the [[Melanocortin 1 receptor|extension gene]], when present, to suppress black color to all but the extremities of the horse; the legs, mane, tail and tips of the ears.  If the extension gene is not present, the effect of agouti is not visible, as there is no black color present to suppress.  Points are most typically seen on a [[bay (horse)|bay]]-colored horse, which has a black mane, tail, legs and ear tips while the body and head will show the underlying [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] or &quot;red&quot; base color. Point coloration may also be visible on horses with [[dilution gene]]s that act upon a bay base coat such as the [[dun gene]] and a single copy of the [[cream gene]].  Other genes or [[horse markings|white markings]] may affect a horse's coat color in addition to agouti, and if present, can further alter or suppress black hair color and may mask any point coloration.  Any [[horse breed]] may have point coloration with the exception of a very small number of [[horse breed]]s where humans have specifically used [[selective breeding]] to eliminate the agouti gene.

==In rabbits==
The classic, pointed white rabbit, as seen in the Himalayan rabbit breed, is created by the ch gene. Sable points, Seal points, Blue Points, Chocolate Points, Lilac Points, Siamese, Pearl, and Sallander do not have the ch gene, which can be seen because they lack the red eyes of true pointed white rabbits. Those colors are created by the cchl, cchd, or cchm gene in conjunction with the e gene. Pointed White rabbits were first seen in the Himalayan breed, and are now seen in the Californian breed, but are accepted varieties in many breeds, including the French Angora, English Angora, Satin Angora, Jersey Wooly, Netherland Dwarf, Holland Lop, Mini Rex, Rex, Satin, Mini Lop, and American Fuzzy Lop, and it is a color in development in Mini Satins. No pointed white Rabbit can produce orange pigment, the points are always black, blue, chocolate or lilac, sometimes in conjunction with white agouti, marten, broken, Vienna, or harlequin patterns, but these are not colors recognized for showing. All pointed white rabbits have red eyes.

'''Feline zoonosis''' are the [[virus|viral]], [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]], [[fungus|fungal]], [[protozoan]], [[nematode]] and [[arthropod]] [[infection]]s that can be transmitted to humans from the domesticated [[cat]], ''Felis catus''. Some of these are diseases are reemerging and newly emerging infections or infestations caused by [[zoonotic]] pathogens transmitted by cats. In some instances, the cat can display symptoms of infection (these may differ from the symptoms in humans) and sometimes the cat remains asymptomatic. There can be serious illnesses and clinical manifestations in people who become infected. This is dependent on the immune status and age of the person. Those who live in close association with cats are more prone to these infections. But those that do not keep cats as pets are also able to acquire these infections because of the transmission can be from cat feces and the parasites that leave their bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomel|first1=Bruno|title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats|journal=Animals|volume=4|issue=3|year=2014|pages=434–445|issn=2076-2615|doi=10.3390/ani4030434|PMID=26480316|pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People can acquire cat-associated infections through bites, scratches or other direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the cat. This includes 'kissing' or letting the animal lick the mouth or nose. Mucous membranes are easily infected when the pathogen is in the mouth of the cat. Pathogens can also infect people when there is contact with animal saliva, urine and other body fluids or secretions, When fecal material is unintentionally ingested, infection can occur. Feline zooinosis can be acquired by a person by inhalation of aerosols or droplets coughed up by the cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;StullBrophy2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stull|first1=J.

In the United States, forty percent of homes have at least one cat. Some contagious infections such as campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cause visible symptoms of the disease in cats. Other infections, such as [[cat scratch disease]] and [[toxoplasmosis]], have no visible symptoms and are carried by apparently healthy cats.&lt;ref name=Ohio2016&gt;{{cite web | title = Cats |publisher=Ohio Department of Health|url = http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats | accessdate = 2016-11-26 |date=January 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cats as vectors==
Some disease-carrying arthropods use cats as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], or carrier. Fleas and ticks can carry pathogenic organisms that infect a person with [[Lyme disease]], tick borne [[encephalitis]], and [[Rocky mountain spotted fever]] &lt;ref name = Chomel2014/&gt;

==Bites==
{{Main|Cat bite}}
Statistics generated by the state of Ohio document that Cat bites are about 20% of all animal bites per year. Bites from cats can not only transmit serious diseases such as rabies,  but bites can develop bacterial infections. The bite of a cat appears small but it can be deep. As many as 80 percent of cat bites become infected.&lt;ref name =Ohio2016/&gt;&lt;ref name= Victoria&gt;{{cite web | title = Zoonoses, Animal diseases that may also affect humans | publisher=Victoria State Government, Australia | url = http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/pests-diseases-and-weeds/animal-diseases/zoonoses/zoonoses-animal-diseases-that-may-also-affect-humans |date=2007| accessdate = 2016-11-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viral==
[[File:Cowpox eruption.jpg|thumb|left|Cowpox infection]]

In 2010, over 400 cases of [[cowpox]] infection from cats to human have been described. The symptoms differ between both humans and cats. In people, local [[exanthema]] appears on the arms and face. The infection resolves on its own but those who are [[immunosuppressed]] can progress to [[systemic infection]] that closely resembles [[smallpox]]. When the infection has expanded to severe symptoms, it can be lethal. The signs of cowpox infection in cats can be seen as, multiple skin sores on the paws, neck, head and mouth. The cat can also develop a [[purulent]] discharge from the eyes. [[Necrotizing pneumonia]] has also been observed. Estimates that 50% of human cases of cowpox are due to transmission from cats in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;/&gt;

==Bacterial==

===''Pasteurella multocida''===
The bacterium ''[[Pasteurella multocida]]'' and its genus can pose a risk of severe diseases in high-risk groups such as the elderly, transplant recipients, cancer patients and immunocompromised individuals. Transmission of the infection to the human from the cat has been attributed to kissing the cat, providing care that exposes the person to the body fluids of the cat and sleeping with the cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GurryCampion2017&quot;/&gt;

===Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''===
[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] is a common type of bacteria that is normally found on the skin of people and cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;/&gt; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the same bacterium that has become resistant to some antibiotics. Cats and other animals often can carry MRSA without being sick, but MRSA can cause a variety of infections, including of the skin, respiratory tract, and urinary tract of people. MRSA can be transmitted back and forth between people and animals through direct contact. In people, MRSA most often causes skin infections that can range from mild to severe. If left untreated, MRSA can spread to the bloodstream or lungs and cause life-threatening infections.&lt;ref name=CDCcats2016&gt;{{cite web | title = Cats, Healthy Pets, Healthy People | publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

===Plague===
Cats are known to transmit [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Plague can take three forms: bubonic plague, primary septicemic plague, and primary pneumonic plague.&lt;ref name=Bruno2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GageDennis2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gage|first1=K.

===Chagas disease===
Transmission of [[Chagas disease]] has been documented and is associated with sleeping with cats.&lt;ref name=Bruno2011/&gt;

===Leishmaniasis===
[[Leishmaniasis]]  is a newly emerging pathogen in Texas.&lt;ref name = Chomel2014/&gt;

===''Staphylococcus intermedius''===
The ''[[Staphylococcus intermedius]]'' bacteria, a common commensal on cats, is associated with infection in humans.&lt;ref name=Bruno2011/&gt;

===''Cheyletiells blakei''===
''[[Cheyletiella blakei]]'' infection has been associated with sleeping with a cat. It is manifested by bullous and vesicles that are intensly itchy. The bacterium is present on the cat's skin.&lt;ref name=Bruno2011/&gt;

===''Capnocytophaga canimorsus''===
''[[Capnocytophaga canimorsus]]'' [[septicemia]] has also been associated with infection in cat owners.&lt;ref name=Bruno2011/&gt;

===Leptospirosis===
[[Leptospirosis]] infection associated with cat urine has been identified as an emerging bacterial pathogen in some European countries. In infected humans, jaundice may or may not be a symptom. If jaundice is a symptom the infection becomes more severe and rapidly progresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;SchullerFrancey2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuller|first1=S.|last2=Francey|first2=T.|last3=Hartmann|first3=K.|last4=Hugonnard|first4=M.|last5=Kohn|first5=B.|last6=Nally|first6=J.

===Tuberculosis and influenza===
Different strains of the [[tuberculosis]] bacterium  (''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]'', ''[[M. tuberculosis]]'' and ''[[M. microti]]'') have been isolated from cats and associated with infection with the presence of the bacterium in their owners, but a definitive cause has not been established. Neither has one strain of [[influenza]] been proven to infect pet owners, though infected cats can [[Contagious disease|infect]] other cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;/&gt;

===Kennel cough===
''[[Bordetella bronchiseptica]]'' has been identified in cats with owners that also are infected with this pathogen. Individuals having this infection have usually been cancer or transplant patients. Those with this infection can develop serious pneumonia.&lt;ref name = Chomel2014/&gt;

==Echinococcosis==
''[[Echinococcus multilocularis]]''  can infect cats and then transmitted to their owners to cause human [[alveolar]] [[echinococcosis]]. Foxes have transmitted this pathogen to cats in Germany, Austria, France and Japan.&lt;ref name = Chomel2014/&gt;

==Arthropods==
[[Cheyletiellosis]] (also known as Cheyletiella dermatitis) is a mild, short-term skin inflammation caused by the mite ''[[Cheyletiella blakei]]'' that feeds on a person's skin cells. It is spread through contact with infested cats. Though not a common ectoparasite, it may be an emerging pathogen in California. The infected cat may have no signs of infection. However, affected kittens may have patches of scaly skin with dandruff. The most common symptoms of cheyletiellosis in people include itching, redness, and raised bumps on areas of the skin that touched the infested animal.  Cheyletiellosis in people generally resolves on its own.&lt;ref name=CDCcats2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SchullerFrancey2015&quot;/&gt;

==Fungi==
Cats are reservoirs and are able to transmit mycotic infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McPhee |first=Stephen |title=Current medical diagnosis &amp; treatment 2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=9780071763721 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cats, especially kittens can pass on a [[Ringworm]] infection to people. Ringworm is a fungal disease and approximately 40 types of fungi can cause ringworm. They are typically of the ''[[Trichophyton]]'', ''[[Microsporum]]'', or ''[[Epidermophyton]]'' type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/definition.html|title=Definition of Ringworm | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = April 30, 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It gets its name from the characteristic ring-like [[rash]] on the skin. The disease is spread by touching an infected cat. The rash may be scaly, reddened, and circular. Ringworm on the scalp usually makes a bald patch of scaly skin. Long-haired  cats do not always show signs of ringworm infection. Kittens with ringworm have patches that are hairless, circular, or irregularly shaped areas of scaling, crusting, and redness that may or may not be itchy. The area may not be completely hairless, and instead have brittle, broken hairs. If the claws are affected, they may have a whitish, opaque appearance with shredding of the claw's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/ringworm.html|title=Ringworm - Healthy Pets Healthy People | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = April 30, 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sporotrichosis]] is a fungal disease that is transmitted by mostly outdoor cats.&lt;ref name = Chomel2014/&gt;

==Platyhelminthes==
[[File:Paragonimus westermani 01.jpg|thumb|The lung fluke ''Paragonimus westermani'']]

Paragonimiasis, or [[lung fluke]] uses cats as a reservoir and subsequently can transmit the infection to humans. Symptoms in cats have not been observed. There are over nine species of lung flukes that can be transmitted to humans from cats. The disease has been found in Asia, Africa, India, North, South and Central America. It is not uncommon and estimates of those infected are in the millions. Signs symptoms in humans are [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], migration of the flukes into other body organs including the central nervous system. There it can cause neurological symptoms such as [[headache]], confusion, [[convulsion]]s, vision problems, and [[stroke|bleeding in the brain]]. This infection in humans is sometimes mistaken for tuberculosis.{{sfn|Heymann|pages=443-445}}

[[Onchocercosis]] has been associated with pet cats in a few cases.&lt;ref name = Chomel2014/&gt;

Cats can harbor and transmit hookworms to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/animals.html|title= Parasites - Animals (Zoonotic)|accessdate=19 June 2017 | date = |publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention }}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protozoans==
[[Cryptosporidiosis]] is a parasitic disease that is transmitted through contaminated food or water from an infected person or animal. Cryptosporidiosis in cats is rare, but they can carry the [[protozoan]] without showing any signs of illness. Cryptosporidiosis can cause profuse, watery diarrhea with cramping, abdominal pain, and nausea in people. Illness in people is usually self-limiting and lasts only 2–4 days, but can become severe in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;ref name=CDCcats2016/&gt; Cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium spp.) Cats transmit the protozoan through their feces. The symptoms in people weight loss and chronic diarrhea in high-risk patients. More than one species of this genus can be acquired by people. Dogs can also transmit this parasite.&lt;ref name=&quot;StullBrophy2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruno2011&gt;{{cite web | title=Zoonoses in the Bedroom|first1=Bruno B.|last1=Chomel|first2=Ben|last2=Sun|date=January 26, 2011|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

&lt;!--==Treatment==--&gt;

==Prevention==
One strategy for the prevention of infection transmission between cats and people is to better educate people on the behaviour that puts them at risk for becoming infected.&lt;ref name=&quot;GurryCampion2017&quot;/&gt;

Those at the highest risk of contracting a disease from a cat are those with behaviors that include: being licked, sharing food, sharing kithchen utensils, kissing, and sleeping with a cat.&lt;ref name =Chomel2014/&gt; The very young, the elderly and those who are immunocompromised increase their risk of becoming infected when sleeping with their cats (and dogs).  The CDC recommends that cat owners not allow a cat to lick your face because it can result in disease transmission. If someone is licked on their face, mucous membranes or an open wound, the risk for infection is reduced if the area is immediately washed with soap and water. Maintaining the health of the animal by regular inspection for fleas and ticks, scheduling deworming medications along with veterinary exams will also reduce the risk of acquiring a feline zoonosis.&lt;ref name=Bruno2011/&gt;

Recommendations for the prevention of ringworm transmission to people include:
* regularly vacuuming areas of the home that pets commonly visit helps to remove fur or flakes of skin
* washing the hands with soap and running water after playing with or petting your pet.
*wearing gloves and long sleeves when handling cats infected with.
*disinfect areas the pet has spent time in, including surfaces and bedding.
**the spores of this fungus can be killed with common disinfectants like chlorine bleach diluted 1:10 (1/4 cup in 1 gallon of water), benzalkonium chloride, or strong detergents.
*not handling cats with ringworm by those whose immune system is weak in any way (if you have HIV/AIDS, are undergoing cancer treatment, or are taking medications that suppress the immune system, for example).
*taking the cat to the veterinarian if ringworm infection is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/ringworm.html |title = Ringworm (Dermatophytosis Infection) | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | accessdate = June 19, 2017 | date = April 30, 2014}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 70 cat [[breed]]s, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and [[predator]]y [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a [[social animal|social species]] and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[Cat communication|mewing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]], and [[Guttural|grunting]]), as well as [[cat pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moelk&quot; /&gt;

==Nomenclature and etymology==

The origin of the English word ''[[wikt:cat#English|cat]]'' ([[Old English]] ''catt'') and its counterparts in other [[Germanic languages]] (such as [[German language|German]] ''Katze''), descended from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*kattōn-'', is controversial. It has traditionally thought to be a borrowing from [[Late Latin]] ''cattus'' &quot;domestic cat&quot;, from ''catta'' (used around 75 AD by [[Martial]]),&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Harper, ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', s.v. &quot;cat&quot;, [html], retrieved on 29 September 2009: [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cat].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=George H.|title=English Words and Their Background|publisher=D.

Many references refer to &quot;Berber&quot; ([[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]) ''kaddîska'' &quot;wildcat&quot; and &quot;[[Nubian languages|Nubian]] ''kadīs''&quot; as possible sources or cognates, but M. [[Lionel Bender]] says the Nubian term is a loan from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] قِطَّة ''qiṭṭa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qitta&quot;&gt;John Huehnergard, ''Qitta: Arabic Cats'', in ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Paul Savignac]] suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[wikt:ϣⲁⲩ|ϣⲁⲩ]] (''šau'') &quot;tomcat&quot; or its feminine form suffixed with ''[[wikt:-t#Egyptian|-t]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Savignac, ''Dictionnaire français-gaulois'', s.v. &quot;chat&quot; (Paris: Errance, 2004), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[John Huehnergard]] says &quot;the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Qitta&quot;/&gt; Huehnergard opines it is &quot;equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic&quot;. [[Guus Kroonen]] also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], cf. [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]] ''gađfe'' &quot;female stoat&quot; and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''hölgy'' &quot;stoat; lady, bride&quot; from [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]] ''*käďwä'' &quot;female (of a fur animal)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kroonen|first1=Guus|title=Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic|date=2013|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-18340-7|pages=281f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, ''cat'' is a classic case of a ''[[Wanderwort]]''.

An alternative word is English ''[[wikt:puss#English|puss]]'' (extended as ''pussy'' and ''pussycat''). Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''poes'' or from [[Low German]] ''puuskatte'', related to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''kattepus'', or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''pus'', ''pusekatt''. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puisín'' or ''puiscín''. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/155147#eid27609702|title=Puss|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gramercy Unabridged&quot;&gt;''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language''.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[purebred cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s, by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[Dog breeds|dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw1999&quot; /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all [[Felinae|felines]], they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a &quot;pacing&quot; [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a &quot;diagonal&quot; gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cats and many other animals have a [[Jacobson's organ]] located in their mouths that allows them to taste-smell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around {{convert|38|C|abbr=on}} which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the &quot;prey&quot; item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;
[[File:Kittyply edit1.jpg|thumb|right|The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.]]
To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective [[blink reflex]]es to protect the eyes from damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Case&quot; /&gt;{{rp|47}}

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nash FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute [[equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and flexibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;falling&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[cat righting reflex]]. An individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so, during a fall. The height required for this to occur is around {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Cats without a tail (e.g. [[Manx (cat)|Manx cats]]) also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of [[angular momentum]] to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nguyen 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Feline vaccination|Vaccinations]] are available for many of these diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petmd.com/blogs/thedailyvet/lhuston/2012/dec/veterinary-care-for-your-new-cat-29565 |title=Veterinary Care for Your New Cat |first=Lorie |last=Huston |publisher=petMD |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites.

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pederson 1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to &quot;play&quot; with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do cats play with their food?|url=http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is referred to in the [[idiom]] &quot;cat-and-mouse game&quot; or simply &quot;[[cat and mouse]]&quot;.

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the [[dominance hierarchy]], in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyhausen 1978&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot; /&gt; Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about 1&amp;nbsp;mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which acts to [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induce ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronson 1967&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large [[feral cat colony|colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsus-feral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archivedate=1 May 2008 | title=What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat? |publisher=Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php | title=Torre Argentina cat shelter. | accessdate=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, [[neutering|neutered]], [[immunization|immunized]] against diseases such as rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and [[feline leukemia virus|Leukemia viruses]], and then released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/23815/1/oa_23815.pdf|title=2013 AAFP Feline Vaccination Advisory Panel Report|accessdate=10 August 2017|publisher=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|date=2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsus-feral&quot; /&gt;

The susceptibility of many island birds is undoubtedly due to evolution in the absence of mainland predators, competitors, diseases, and parasites, in addition to lower reproductive rates and extended incubation periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dowding |first1=J.

===Cat bites and scratches===
{{Main|Cat bite}}
Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop.&lt;ref name = kidshealth&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/animal-bites-sheet.html?WT.ac=p-ra|title=First Aid: Animal Bites|publisher = The Nemours Foundation|language=en|access-date=2017-06-18 | date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat bite differs from the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep [[wound|punctures]]. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps [[microorganisms]] that cause [[infection]].&lt;ref name = assh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment|title=Animal Bites|publisher = American Society for Surgery of the Hand | date = 2017 | website=Handcare.org|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kidshealth/&gt;

===Infections transmitted from cats to humans===
{{Main article|Feline zoonosis}}

Cats can be [[infection|infected]] or infested with [[virus]]es, [[pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]], [[fungus]], [[protozoans]], [[arthropod]]s or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;/&gt; In some cases, the cat exhibits no [[symptoms]] of the disease,&lt;ref name=Ohio2016&gt;{{cite web | title = Cats |publisher=Ohio Department of Health|url = http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats | accessdate = 26 November 2016 |date=21 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same disease can then become evident in a human.  The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat [[feces]] and [[parasite]]s exiting the cat's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomel|first1=Bruno|title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats|journal=Animals|volume=4|issue=3|year=2014|pages=434–445|issn=2076-2615|doi=10.3390/ani4030434|PMID=26480316|pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StullBrophy2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stull|first1=J.

===History and mythology===
{{Main article|Cultural depictions of cats|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
[[File:PSM V37 D105 English tabby cat.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th century drawing of a tabby cat]]
Traditionally, historians tended to think [[ancient Egypt]] was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Driscoll&quot; /&gt; However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in [[Shillourokambos]], [[Cyprus]], contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;9500 years&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the [[Fertile Crescent]] around the time of the [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]], and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;DriscollMenotti-Raymond2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OttoniVan Neer2017&quot;/&gt;

Direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5,300 years ago in Quanhucun, [[China]] has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The cats are believed to have been attracted to the village by rodents, which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/vivir/ciencia/Gatos-domesticados-China-hace-anos_0_1385061482.html|title=Gatos fueron domesticados en China hace 5.300 años|work=La Nación|accessdate=9 September 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the ''[[maneki neko]]'' cat is a symbol of good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |title=Maneki Neko: Feline Fact &amp; Fiction |author=Alan Pate |work=Daruma Magazine |publisher=Takeguchi Momoko |location=Amagasaki, Japan |year=2008 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DIDy4b8G?url=http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |archivedate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Superstitions and cat burning ====
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] &quot;crossing one's path&quot; leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck? [Hoax]|url=http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/|website=SocialNewsDaily|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people &quot;shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: a History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-198-20171-0|pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''The Golden Bough'', (1922). [http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010 |author=Nora Sugobono |language=Spanish |title=Las vidas del gato |publisher=El Comercio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127052854/http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qual é a origem da lenda de que os gatos teriam sete vidas?|url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas|website=[[Mundo Estranho]]|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|accessdate=18 March 2010|author=Tim Dowling|title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm|title=The ASPCA Warns About High-Rise Falls by Cats|author=ASPCA|date=30 June 2005|publisher=About.com|accessdate=26 April 2012|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cat]]s (''Felis silvestris catus''), known in [[ancient Egypt]] as &quot;[[Egyptian Mau|Mau]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.breeds.traditionalcats.com/breedinfo/faqegyptianmau/history_of_egyptian_mau.htm |title=History of EGYPTIAN MAU |website=www.breeds.traditionalcats.com |access-date=2016-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419190913/http://www.breeds.traditionalcats.com/breedinfo/faqegyptianmau/history_of_egyptian_mau.htm |archivedate=2016-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were considered sacred in ancient Egyptian society. Based on recent DNA comparisons of living species, it has been estimated that cats were first [[domestication|domesticated]] from the [[African wildcat|Middle Eastern subspecies]] of the [[wildcat]] about 10,000 years ago in the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kingdon|first=J. |title=East African Mammals: Carnivores |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-226-43721-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/science/29cat.html | publisher=New York Times |title= Study Traces Cat’s Ancestry to Middle East | access-date=19 Apr 2010 |first=N. | last=Wade | date=June 29, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of years later, the peoples in what would later be [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] had a [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]] centering on the [[Animal worship|worship of animals]], including cats.{{cnl|date=September 2014}}

Praised for controlling vermin and its ability to kill snakes such as [[cobra]]s, the domesticated cat became a symbol of grace and poise.

As domestication was not as steadfast with cats as today, wealthy families would often curate examples of well bred felines, show them, and pride themselves in the coloration and behavioural adaptations that are seen in today's organized shows.

The goddess [[Mafdet]], the deification of [[justice]] and [[capital punishment|execution]], was a lion-headed goddess. The cat goddess [[Bastet|Bast]] (also known as ''Bastet'') eventually replaced Mafdet, and Bast's image softened over time and she became the deity representing protection, [[fertility]], and [[mother]]hood.

As a revered animal and one important to Egyptian society and religion, some cats  [[cat mummies|received the same mummification after death]] as humans. Mummified cats were given in offering to Bast.{{cnl|reason=cannot find backing evidence for this|date=March 2011}} In 1888, an Egyptian farmer uncovered a large tomb with mummified cats and kittens. This discovery outside the town of [[Beni Hasan]] had eighty thousand [[cat mummies]], dated after 1000 BC.{{Cnl|date=October 2015}} The punishments for harming cats were severe.

[[File:Cat with Kittens, ca. 664-30 B.C.E. or later.jpg|thumb|right|'''''Cat with Kittens'', c. 664-30 BC or later. Bronze, wood.''' The Egyptians associated the female cat’s fertility and motherly care with several divinities. The base of the statuette of Cat with Kittens is inscribed with a request that Bastet grant life, directly linking the cat pictured here with the goddess Bastet. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

Cats were one of the most recognizable species in Egyptian culture and were domesticated much later than dogs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Two types of smaller cats appeared in ancient Egypt: the jungle cat (''Felis chaus'') and the African wild cat (''Felis silvestris libyca''). The African wild cat was domesticated from the Predynastic Period onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg,Edward]] ''Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Wild cats naturally preyed upon the rats and other vermin that ate from the royal [[granary|granaries]]. They earned their place in towns and cities by killing mice, venomous [[snake]]s, and other pests.  They were worshipped by the Egyptians and given jewelry in hieroglyphics.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Small cats would often be found underneath women's chairs on reliefs, evoking fertility and sexuality. The other variety of cat, the lion, was also prevalent in Egyptian culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Although most [[lion]]s receded to the south around the Predynastic Period, lions were rare in pharaonic times, but were extremely important in Egyptian iconography. Lions represented royal authority because of their aggressive nature and power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]], ''Soulful Creatures''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cats in Egyptian religion==
[[File:Ancient Egyptian bronze statue of a reclining cat and kitten.jpg|left|thumb|A [[bronze]] statue of a domesticated cat and her kitten]]

The earliest evidence of felines as deities comes from a {{circa}} 3100 BC crystal cup decorated with an image of the cat-headed goddess [[Mafdet]]. The goddess [[Bastet]] was originally depicted as a fiercely protective and warlike [[lion]]ess, like [[Sekhmet]], but as Bastet's image &quot;softened&quot; over time, she became more strongly associated with domestic cats.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

As cats were sacred to Bast, the practice of [[mummy|mummification]] was extended to them,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and the respect that cats received after death mirrored the respect with which they were treated in everyday life. The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that in the event of a fire, men would guard the fire to make certain that no cats ran into the flame. Herodotus also wrote that when a cat died, the household would go into mourning as if for a human relative, and would often shave their eyebrows to signify their loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KdUNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA308|title=All the Year Round|first=Charles|last=Dickens|year=1862|page=308|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diodorus Siculus]] describes an interesting example of swift justice imposed upon the killer of a cat: about 60 BC, he witnessed a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] accidentally kill an Egyptian cat. An outraged mob gathered and, despite pleas from pharaoh [[Ptolemy XII Auletes|Ptolemy XII]], killed the Roman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&amp;pg=PA39|title=Diodorus Siculus, Book 1|publisher=|page=39|first=Anne |last=Burton|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bubastis and the cult of the cat==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Egyptian - Statue of a Seated Cat - Walters 54403 - Three Quarter.jpg|left|thumb|This seated cat has golden earrings, a golden scarab inlaid on the forehead, and a necklace with a pendant in low relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/35906 |title= Statue of a Seated Cat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]

Although the cat cult was a religious movement by the beginning of the [[New Kingdom]], it gained importance when [[Shoshenq I]] (c. 943–922 BC) developed [[Bubastis]], chief centre of worship for the goddess Bast, located east of the [[Nile Delta]], into an important city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} At the same time, Bast developed into an immensely popular and important deity representing fertility, motherhood, protection, and the benevolent aspects of the sun – along with [[Sekhmet]], she was known as the [[Eye of Ra]]. The cult of the cat garnered a huge following, and thousands of pilgrims journeyed each year to Bubastis to celebrate. ''Bubastis'' also became another name by which the goddess was known.

Close to the centre of the city lay a large temple to Bast. This temple was in a depression, and thus at a lower elevation than the rest of the city that had been raised to minimize flood damage from the nearby Nile. Herodotus, who visited the city in 450 BC, wrote that although the size of the shrine to Bast was perhaps &quot;not as large as those of other cities, and probably not as costly, no temple in all of Egypt gave more pleasure to the eye.&quot;

Herodotus went on to describe the temple in detail. A canal within this depression gave the temple the appearance of a man-made island. In the courtyard was a grove of trees leading the way to the interior, containing a massive statue of Bast, and a great number of sacred cats, cared for by the temple priests with donations from pilgrims. The temple's cat population, while respected, was extremely large, and needed to be moderated by the periodic sacrificial culling of kittens, which were then mummified and sold to pilgrims as [[relic]]s.

Bubastis became a marketplace for merchants of all sorts; artisans came forth with thousands of bronze sculptures and [[amulet]]s depicting cats to worshippers of Bast. These amulets commonly featured an image of a cat and its kittens, and were often used by women trying to have children, praying to Bast, or Bastet that they be granted the same number of children as kittens depicted on the amulet.

Herodotus wrote that the annual festival of Bast held in the city was one of the most popular of all, with attendees from all over Egypt, who would raft down the Nile celebrating and feasting all the way. When they arrived in Bubastis, they feasted yet more and made sacrifices to Bast.
&lt;!-- By 525 BC, Egypt was essentially the only empire not conquered by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. At that point [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses]], the son of [[Cyrus the Great]], set out to do just that.  Cambyses and his army crossed the fifty-six mile stretch of desert to the Egyptian outpost of Pelesium on camelback; they then clashed down upon the Egyptian army who were reluctant to strike back at the sacred symbol of the cat upon the Persian shields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} --&gt;

==Funerary traditions==
[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]
{{See also|Cat mummies}}
Herodotus noted that cats that died anywhere in Egypt were often taken to Bubastis to be [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried in the great [[cemetery]], but this may or may not have been the case. At the burial site in Bubastis the Swiss [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologist]] [[Édouard Naville]] found more than 20&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (720 cubic feet) of cat remains but also a great deal of evidence of [[cremation]]. Naville found stacks of cat bones in many pits, the walls of which were made up of bricks and clay. Near each pit lay a furnace, its bricks blackened from fire. This discovery causes some problems. The mummification and preservation of the body was intended to make it possible for the deceased's ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' to locate its host and subsequently be reborn into the [[afterlife]]. As the body would have to be intact for this process to occur, cremation would seem an undesirable way of dealing with the body of a sacred creature with a ''ka''. Nevertheless, many cats were afforded the full embalming ceremony and buried in other great cemeteries along the Nile.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In her book ''The Cult of the Cat'', Patricia Dale-Green states that, &quot;The cat's body was placed in a [[linen]] sheet and carried amidst bitter lamentations by the bereaved to a sacred house where it was treated with drugs and spices by an embalmer.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dale-Green&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cult of the Cat | publisher=Weathervane Books | author=Patricia Dale-Green | year=1963 | isbn=978-0-517-17500-2 | chapter=The White Cat}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}
She goes on to state that although the cat of an Egyptian noble would receive more extravagant burial status, the body of a worker's cat would still be carefully prepared and the embalming carried out with the same conscientiousness as for a human body, often with provisions for the afterlife such as pots of milk and even mummified mice.&lt;ref name=Dale-Green /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Nowhere, perhaps, is this appreciation shown more than in the colossal tomb at the temple of Bast discovered in 1888. This tomb, outside of [[Beni Hasan]], held more than nineteen tonnes of animal mummies and remains, the vast majority being cats but a number of [[mongoose]]s, dogs, and [[fox]]es were amongst the specimens that made it to the [[British Museum]]. The farmer who made the discovery sold most of the tomb's contents to be ground up as fertilizer, but a number of specimens made it into the hands of scientists for testing and examination. Some of these are on display at the British Museum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|William Martin Conway]] wrote: &quot;The plundering of the cemetery was a sight to see, but one had to stand well windward. The village children came from day to day and provided themselves with the most attractive mummies they could find. These they took down the river bank to sell for the smallest coin to passing travelers.  The path became strewn with mummy cloth and bits of cats' skulls and bones and fur in horrid positions, and the wind blew the fragments about and carried the stink afar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conway, M. 1891. The Dawn of Art in the Ancient World. Macmillan and Co., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the making of his documentary for the BBC, ''Cats: The Rise of the Cat'', Roger Tabor discovered a further cat cemetery at Bast's temple. This find consists of a twenty centimetre-thick layer of compressed mummies which spans more than sixty metres in length.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Decline of cat-worship==
The worship of all Pagan gods, including Bast, was officially banned by imperial decree in 390 AD. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=White|first=Cynthia |title=The Emergence of Christianity |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2007 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt has since experienced a decline in the respect once held for cats; they are still kept as pets and tolerated elsewhere because they catch pests. Even so, the cat has not lost all religious significance with modern Egypt's largely Islamic population, since cats are also [[Cats and Islam|revered to some extent in Muslim tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/040.sbt.html |title=Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 40: Distribution of Water |work=usc.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309200330/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/040.sbt.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=3207|title=Cats and Islam|work=The Muslim Observer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711002321/http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=3207|archivedate=2012-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[anatomy]] of the [[Cat|domestic cat]]''' is similar to that of other members of the genus ''[[Felis]]''.
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Mouth==
{{Infobox 
|image   = [[File:Catsmouthraoukie.jpg|300px|center]] 
|caption = A yawning cat, exposing its mouth
}}

Cats have highly specialized [[tooth|teeth]] for the killing of prey and the tearing of meat. The ''[[premolar]]'' and ''[[Molar (tooth)|first molar]]'', together the ''[[carnassial]] pair'' are located on each side of the mouth. These teeth efficiently function to shear meat like a pair of scissors. While this is present in [[Canidae|canids]], it is highly developed in felines.

The cat's [[tongue]] has sharp spines, or ''[[Filiform papilla|papillae]]'', useful for retaining and ripping flesh from a carcass. These papillae are small backward-facing hooks that contain [[keratin]] which also assist in their [[Personal grooming|grooming]].

The cat's oral structures provide for a variety of vocalizations used for [[cat communication|communication]], including meowing, purring, hissing, growling, squeaking, chirping, clicking, and grunting.

==Ears==

{{Infobox

|caption = A cat's ear which has special fur for sensing and protection
}}

Thirty-two individual muscles in each ear allow for a manner of [[directional hearing]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = At Home: Care / Health: Understanding Cats | url = http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/ah_pets_care_health/article/0,1801,HGTV_3152_1380540,00.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201133606/http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/ah_pets_care_health/article/0%2C1801%2CHGTV_3152_1380540%2C00.html | archivedate = 1 February 2008 | accessdate = 15 August 2005 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a cat can move each ear independently of the other. Because of this mobility, a cat can move its body in one direction and point its ears in another direction. Most cats have straight ears pointing upward. Unlike [[dog]]s, flap-eared breeds are extremely rare (''[[Scottish Fold]]s'' are one such exceptional [[mutation]]). When angry or frightened, a cat will lay back its ears to accompany the growling or hissing sounds it makes. Cats also turn their ears back when they are playing or to listen to a sound coming from behind them. The fold of skin forming a pouch on the lower posterior part of the ear, known as [[Henry's pocket]], is usually prominent in a cat's ear.&lt;ref name=&quot;consultations&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = August| first = John| authorlink = | title = Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine, Volume 6 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2009 | location = | pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of unknown function, though it may assist in filtering sounds.

==Nose==
[[File:Detalhe nariz Osk.jpg|thumb|upright|A cat's nose is highly adapted]]
Cats are highly territorial and secreting odors plays a major role in cat communication. The nose helps cats to identify territories, other cats and mates, to locate food, and for various other causes.&lt;ref name=About.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Syufy F.|title=The Nose Knows Cats' Amazing Sense of Scent|url=http://cats.about.com/cs/felineanatomy/a/catsnose_scent.htm|work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat's sense of smell is believed to be about fourteen times stronger than that of humans. The [[rhinarium]] (the leathery bit of nose we see) is quite tough to allow it to absorb rather rough treatment sometimes. The color varies according to the [[genotype]] (genetic makeup) of the cat. Cat's skin has the same color as the fur but the color of the nose leather is probably dictated by a dedicated gene. Cats with white fur have skin susceptible to damage by [[ultraviolet light]] that may cause cancer. Extra care is required when outside in hot sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org|title=Cat Anatomy|url=http://cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2008/07/cat-anatomy.html|date=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legs==

Cats, like dogs, are [[digitigrade]]s. They walk directly on their [[toe]]s, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacquaniti 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic cats are capable of walking very precisely, as is true for all cats.  Like all [[felinae|felines]], they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding forepaw, minimizing noise and visible tracks.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. The two back legs allow falling and leaping far distances without injury.

Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a &quot;pacing&quot; [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a &quot;diagonal&quot; gait, similar to that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move simultaneously. Cat height can vary depending on breed and/or gender, but is usually around 12 inches or 30.5 centimeters&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

==Claws==
{{redirect|Cat claw|the superhero|Cat Claw|the plant species|Cat's claw}}
[[File:Cat claw closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=|A cat's claw]]
Like nearly all members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Felidae]], cats have retractable [[claw]]s. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the [[skin]] and [[fur]] around the [[paw|toe pads]]. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Outline of Cat Lessons|journal=The School Journal|date=22 December 1900|first=Annetta F.|last=Armes|volume=LXI|issue=|page=659|id= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-_gBAAAAYAAJ|format=|accessdate=12 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, &quot;[[Kneading (cats)|kneading]]&quot;, or for extra traction on soft surfaces (bedspreads, thick rugs, skin, etc.). It is also possible to make a cooperative cat extend its claws by carefully pressing both the top and bottom of the paw. The curved claws can become entangled in carpet or thick fabric, which can cause injury if the cat is unable to free itself.

Most cats have a total of 18 digits and claws. 5 on each forefoot, the 5th digit being the [[dewclaw]]; and 4 on each hind foot. The dewclaw is located high on the foreleg, is not in contact with the ground and is non-weight bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cats Claws further reading|url=http://www.cat-talk-101.com/cat-claws.html|website=Cat Talk 101.com|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cats can have more than 18 digits, example: five on their rear paws ([[Polydactyl cat|polydactylyism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Danforth1947&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Because of an ancient [[mutation]], however, some domestic and feral cats are born with polydactylyism (particularly in the east coast of [[Canada]] and northeast coast of the [[United States]]), with six or seven toes.

==Temperature and heart rate==

[[File:2 russian street cats-crop.jpg|thumb|alt=Two cats curled up together|Two cats sharing body heat]]
The normal [[thermoregulation|body temperature]] of a cat is between {{Convert|38.33|and|39.0|°C|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Normal Values For Dog and Cat Temperature, Blood Tests, Urine and other information in ThePetCenter.com | url = http://www.thepetcenter.com/exa/nv.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050313085435/http://www.thepetcenter.com/exa/nv.html |archivedate=13 March 2005 | accessdate = 1 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat is considered ''[[fever|febrile]]'' ([[hyperthermia|hyperthermic]]) if it has a temperature of {{Convert|39.5|°C}} or greater, or ''[[hypothermia|hypothermic]]'' if less than {{Convert|37.5|°C}}. For comparison, humans have an average [[Human body temperature|body temperature]] of about {{Convert|98.6|°F|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/normal_body_temperature&lt;/ref&gt; A domestic cat's normal heart rate ranges from 140 to 220 beats per minute (bpm), and is largely dependent on how excited the cat is. For a cat at rest, the average heart rate usually is between 150 and 180&amp;nbsp;bpm, more than twice that of a human, which averages 70 bpm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090413173009/http://highlanderpetcenter.com/content/view/24/2 Cat Health And Cat Metabolism Information For The Best Cat Care].

== Skin ==
Cats possess rather loose skin; this allows them to turn and confront a predator or another cat in a fight, even when it has a grip on them. This is also an advantage for [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] purposes, as it simplifies [[Injection (medicine)|injections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vaccinate Your Cat at Home | url = http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=87 | accessdate = 18 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the lives of cats with [[renal failure|kidney failure]] can sometimes be extended for years by the regular injection of large volumes of fluid subcutaneously, which serves as an alternative to [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cat Comes Back | url = http://www.wgrz.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=37606 | accessdate = 1 March 2010|author=Kellman, Rich }}{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How to Give Subcutaneous Fluids to a Cat | url = http://www.wikihow.com/Give-Subcutaneous-Fluids-to-a-Cat | accessdate = 18 October 2006|work=wikihow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Scruff
The particularly loose skin at the back of the neck is known as the ''[[nape|scruff]]'', and is the area by which a mother cat grips her [[kitten]]s to carry them. As a result, cats tend to become quiet and passive when gripped there. This behavior also extends into adulthood, when a male will grab the female by the scruff to immobilize her while he mounts, and to prevent her from running away as the mating process takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scruffing your dog or cat | url = http://www.pets.ca/articles/article_scruffing.htm |work=pets.c| accessdate = 26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique can be useful when attempting to treat or move an uncooperative cat. However, since an adult cat is heavier than a kitten, a pet cat should never be carried by the scruff, but should instead have its weight supported at the rump and hind legs, and at the chest and front paws.{{Or|date=August 2010}}

; Primordial pouches
Some cats share common traits due to heredity. One of those is the primordial pouch, sometimes referred to as &quot;spay sway&quot; by owners who notice it once the cat has been spayed or neutered. It is located on a cat's belly. Its appearance is similar to a loose flap of skin that might occur if the cat had been overweight and had then lost weight. It provides a little extra protection against kicks, which are common during cat fights as a cat will try to rake with its rear claws. In wild cats, the ancestors of domesticated felines, this pouch appears to be present to provide extra room in case the animal has the opportunity to eat a large meal and the stomach needs to expand. This stomach pouch also allows the cat to bend and expand, allowing for faster running and higher jumping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pets.thenest.com/primordial-pouch-cats-11178.html What Is the Primordial Pouch in Cats? by Nicholas DeMarino at pets.thenest.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cat skeleton.jpg|thumb|Cat skeleton]]
Cats have seven [[cervical vertebrae]] like almost all [[mammals]], thirteen [[thoracic vertebrae]] (humans have twelve), seven [[lumbar vertebrae]] (humans have five), three [[sacrum|sacral vertebrae]] (humans have five because of their bipedal posture), and, except for [[Manx (cat)|Manx cat]]s and other shorter tailed cats, twenty-two or twenty-three [[caudal vertebrae]] (humans have three to five, fused into an internal [[coccyx]]). The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal vertebrae form the ''[[tail]]'', used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements.  Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings.

Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating [[clavicle]] bones, which allows them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillis 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Muscles==
[[File:Superficial muscles of a cat.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Labelled diagram of the muscular system of a cat|Diagram of the muscular system of a cat]]

===Internal Abdominal Oblique===

This muscle's origin is the lumbodorsal fascia and ribs. Its [[insertion (anatomy)|insertion]] is at the pubis and [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] (via aponeurosis), and its action is the compression of abdominal contents. It also laterally flexes and rotates the vertebral column.

===Transversus Abdominis===

This muscle is the innermost abdominal muscle. Its origin is the second sheet of the lumbodorsal fascia and the pelvic girdle and its insertion is the linea alba. Its action is the compression of the abdomen.

===Rectus Abdominis===

To see this muscle, first remove the extensive aponeurosis situated on the [[ventral]] surface of the cat. Its fibers are extremely longitudinal, on each side of the linea alba. It is also traversed by the inscriptiones tendinae, or what others called ''[[myosepta]]''.

===Deltoid===
The '''deltoid muscles''' lie just lateral to the [[trapezius muscles]], originating from several fibers spanning the clavicle and scapula, converging to insert at the humerus. Anatomically, there are only two deltoids in the cat, the ''acromiodeltoid'' and the ''spinodeltoid''. However, to conform to [[human anatomy]] standards, the clavobrachialis is now also considered a deltoid and is commonly referred to as the ''clavodeltoid''.

====Acromiodeltoid====
The acromiodeltoid is the shortest of the deltoid muscles. It lies lateral to (to the side of) the clavodeltoid, and in a more husky cat it can only be seen by lifting or reflecting the clavodeltoid. It originates at the acromion process and inserts at the deltoid ridge. When contracted, it raises and rotates the humerus outward.

====Spinodeltoid====
A stout and short muscle lying posterior to the acromiodeltoid. It lies along the lower border of the scapula, and it passes through the upper arm, across the upper end of muscles of the upper arm. It originates at the spine of the scapula and inserts at the deltoid ridge. Its action is to raise and rotate the humerus outward.

===Head===

====Masseter====
The '''Masseter''' is a great, powerful, and very thick muscle covered by a tough, shining [[fascia]] lying [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] to the [[zygomatic arch]], which is its origin. It inserts into the [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] half of the [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] surface of the [[mandible]]. Its action is the elevation of the mandible (closing of the jaw).

====Temporalis====
The '''temporalis''' is a great mass of mandibular muscle, and is also covered by a tough and shiny fascia. It lies [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] to the zygomatic arch and fills the [[temporal fossa]] of the [[skull]]. It arises from the side of the skull and inserts into the coronoid process of the mandible. It too, elevates the jaw.

===Integumental===
The two main integumentary muscles of a cat are the ''[[platysma]]'' and the ''cutaneous maximus''. The ''cutaneous maximus'' covers the dorsal region of the cat and allows it to shake its skin. The ''platysma'' covers the neck and allows the cat to stretch the skin over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles.

===Neck and back===

====Rhomboideus====
The Rhomboideus is a thick, large muscle below the [[Trapezius muscles]]. It extends from the vertebral border of the scapula to the mid-dorsal line. Its origin is from the neural spines of the first four thoracic vertebrae, and its insertion is at the vertebral border of the scapula. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal.

====Rhomboideus Capitis====
The Rhomboideus capitis is the most cranial of the deeper muscles. It is underneath the [[Trapezius muscles|Clavotrapezius]]. Its origin is the superior nuchal line, and its insertion is at the scapula. Action draws scapula cranially.

====Splenius====
The Splenius is the most superficial of all the deep muscles. It is a thin, broad sheet of muscle underneath the [[Trapezius muscles|Clavotrapezius]] and deflecting it. It is crossed also by the Rhomboideus capitis. Its origin is the mid-dorsal line of the neck and fascia. The insertion is the superior nuchal line and atlas. It raises or turns the head.

====Serratus Ventralis====
The Serratus Ventralis is exposed by cutting the wing-like [[Latissimus Dorsi]]. The said muscle is covered entirely by [[adipose tissue]]. The origin is from the first nine or ten ribs and from part of the cervical vertebrae.

====Serratus Dorsalis====
The Serratus Dorsalis is medial to both the scapula and the Serratus Ventralis. Its origin is via apoeurosis following the length of the mid-dorsal line, and its insertion is the dorsal portion of the last ribs. Its action is to depress and retracts the ribs during breathing.

====Intercostals====
The Intercostals are a set of muscles sandwiched among the ribs. They interconnect ribs, and are therefore the primary respiratory skeletal muscles. They are divided into the ''external'' and the ''internal subscapularis''. The origin and insertion are in the ribs. The intercostals pull the ribs backwards or forwards.

====Caudofemoralis====
The [[Caudofemoralis]] is a muscle found in the pelvic limb. &lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, L. J. (1990). ''Anatomy of the Cat: Text and Dissection Guide''. Wm. C. Brown Publishers Dubuque, IA. p. 110, {{ISBN|0697055795}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caudofemoralis acts to flex the tail laterally to its respective side when the pelvic limb is bearing weight. When the pelvic limb is lifted off the ground, contraction of the Caudofemoralis causes the limb to abduct and the shank to extend by extending the hip joint.

===Pectoral===

====Pectoantebrachialis====
Pectoantebrachialis muscle is just one-half inch wide and is the most superficial in the pectoral muscles. Its origin is the [[manubrium]] of the [[sternum]], and its insertion is in a flat [[tendon]] on the [[fascia]] of the proximal end of the [[ulna]]. Its action is to draw the arm towards the [[chest]]. There is no human equivalent.

====Pectoralis Major====
The pectoralis major, also called ''pectoralis superficialis'', is a broad triangular portion of the pectoralis muscle which is immediately below the pectoantebrachialis. It is smaller than the pectoralis minor muscle. Its origin is the [[sternum]] and median ventral raphe, and its insertion is at the [[humerus]]. Its action is to draw the [[arm]] towards the [[chest]].

====Pectoralis Minor====
The pectoralis minor muscle is larger than the Pectoralis major. However, most of its anterior border is covered by the pectoralis major. Its origins are ribs three–five, and its insertion is the coracoid process of the scapula. Its actions are the tipping of the scapula and the elevation of ribs three–five.

====Xiphihumeralis====
The most posterior, flat, thin, and long strip of pectoral muscle is the Xiphihumeralis. It is a band of parallel fibers that is found in felines but not in humans. Its origin is the Xiphoid Process of the sternum. The insertion is the humerus.

===Trapezius===
In the [[cat]] there are three thin flat muscles that cover the back, and to a lesser extent, the neck. They pull the scapula toward the mid-dorsal line, anteriorly, and posteriorly.

====Clavotrapezius====
The most anterior of the trapezius muscles, it is also the largest. Its fibers run obliquely to the ventral surface. Its origin is the superior nuchal line and median dorsal line and its insertion is the [[clavicle]]. Its action is to draw the clavicle dorsally and towards the head.

====Acromiotrapezius====
Acromiotrapezius is the middle trapezius muscle. It covers the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the scapula. Its origin is the neural spines of the cervical vertebrae and its insertion is in the metacromion process and fascia of the clavotrapezius. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal, and hold the two scapula together.

====Spinotrapezius====
Spinotrapezius, also called ''thoracic trapezius'', is the most posterior of the three. It is triangular shaped. Posterior to the acromiotrapezius and overlaps latissimus dorsi on the front. Its origin is the neural spines of the thoracic vertebrae and its insertion is the scapular fascia. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal and caudal region.
==Digestive system==
The digestion system of cats begins with their sharp teeth. Their sharp teeth help them tear meat which is most if not all of their diet. Cats naturally do not have a diet high in carbohydrates, and therefore, their saliva doesn’t contain the enzyme amylase.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system&lt;/ref&gt;Food moves from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach. The gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats contains a small cecum and unsacculated colon.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DZuAsci2apAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=cat+digestive+system&amp;ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&amp;sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The cecum while similar to dogs, doesn’t have a coiled cecum. The stomach of the cat can be divided into distinct regions of motor activity. The proximal end of the stomach relaxes when food is digested.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DZuAsci2apAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=cat+digestive+system&amp;ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&amp;sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;While food is being digested this portion of the stomach either has rapid stationary contractions or a sustained tonic contraction of muscle.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DZuAsci2apAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=cat+digestive+system&amp;ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&amp;sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These different actions result in either the food being moved around or the food moving towards the distal portion of the stomach.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DZuAsci2apAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=cat+digestive+system&amp;ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&amp;sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;The distal portion of the stomach undergoes rhythmic cycles of partial depolarization.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system&lt;/ref&gt;This depolarization sensitizes muscle cells so they are more likely to contract. The stomach is not only a muscular structure, it also serves a chemical function by releasing hydrochloric acid and other digestive enzymes to break down food. Food moves from the stomach into the small intestine. The first part of the small intestine is the duodenum. As food moves through the duodenum it mixes with bile, a fluid that neutralizes stomach acid and emulsifies fat. Bile is created in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. The pancreas releases enzymes that aid in digestion so that nutrients can be broken down and pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood and travel to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DZuAsci2apAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=cat+digestive+system&amp;ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&amp;sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;The pancreas doesn’t produce starch processing enzymes because cats don’t eat a diet high in carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system&lt;/ref&gt;   Since the cat digests low amounts of glucose, the pancreas uses amino acids to trigger insulin release instead of glucose. Food then moves on to the jejunum. This is the most nutrient absorptive section of the small intestine. The liver regulates the level of nutrients absorbed into the blood system from the small intestine. From the jejunum, whatever food that has not been absorbed is sent to the ileum which connects to the large intestine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cat-health-detective.com/cat-digestive-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;The first part of the large intestine is the cecum and the second portion is the colon. The large intestine reabsorbs water and forms fecal matter. There are some things that the cats are not able to digest. For example, cats clean themselves by licking their fur with their tongue, which causes them to swallow a lot of fur. This causes a build-up of fur in a cat’s stomach and creates a mass of fur. This is often thrown up and is better known as a hair ball.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vetinfo.com/cat-digestive-diseases.html&lt;/ref&gt; The short length of the digestive tract of the cat causes cats’ digestive system to weigh less than other species of animals, which allows cats to be active predators.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system&lt;/ref&gt; While cats are well adapted to be predators they have a limited ability to regulate catabolic enzymes of amino acids meaning amino acids are constantly being destroyed and not absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system&lt;/ref&gt;Therefore, cats have a higher protein requirement in their diet than many other species. Cats are not adapted to synthesize niacin from tryptophan and because they are carnivores can’t convert carotene to vitamin A so eating plants while not harmful does not provide them nutrients. Understanding the digestive system of a domestic cat is very important for pet owners. If a pet owner understands how the different parts work together then if a problem occurs they could potentially help the cat’s situation even before taking it to a vet.

In the female cat, the genitalia include two gonads, the uterus, the vagina, the genital passages and teats. Together with the vulva, the [[vagina]] of the cat is involved in mating and provides a channel for newborns during ''parturition'', or birth. The vagina is long and wide.&lt;ref name=aniwa&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122935/http://www.aniwa.com/en/general/Grand_Public/document/100358/28398/index.htm  The cat's genital system and reproduction]. aniwa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Genital passages are the [[oviducts]] of the cat. They are short, narrow, and not very sinuous.&lt;ref name=aniwa/&gt;

===Male genitalia===

**Pasteurellosis is a bacterial disease associated with animal bites and scratches. Pasteurella is a normal bacterium that also lives in the mouths of healthy cats. The [[nonpathogenic organisms|bacteria]] do not typically make cats sick; however, cats can develop abscesses or skin infections in places where they were scratched or bitten by another animal.
In people, pasteurellosis causes painful wound and skin infections. In severe cases, it can cause widespread infection and might even affect the nervous system.
*Rabies, a fatal neurologic disease in animals and people, is caused by a virus. Animals and people are most commonly infected through bites from rabid animals. Infected cats may have a variety of signs, but most often have sudden behavioral changes and progressive paralysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/cats.html {{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries==
The teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed and cause deep wounds and skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and trap microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment|title=Animal Bites|website=Handcare.org|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ==Characteristics== --&gt;&lt;!--==Causes==
===Risk factors=== --&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is aided by obtaining a history of the circumstances surrounding the bite. The time the bite was experienced,  the location of the bite, and examination of the bite is noted. The person may have drainage from the site of the bite. They may also be febrile. Swelling may also occur. Because the wound from the bite may have healed over the punctures, the wound it may be opened and explored. The site is anesthetized prior to exploration of the wound for is examined for damage. Neurovascular status is assessed. Immune status may determine treatment as does  
the presence of transplanted tissue or organs, rheumatic disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and sickle cell disease.
Swollen glands (lymph nodes) and red streaks radiating upward may be evident.&lt;ref name = AAP/&gt;&lt;ref name = med/&gt;&lt;ref name = Man2017/&gt;

The diagnosis of a cat with rabies is evident by observing the cat. Cats with rabies may also appear restless, pant, and attack other animals, people, or objects. Animals with rabies typically die within a few days of appearing sick.  Vaccination of the cat can prevent rabies being transmitted by the cat through a bite. If the cat is suspected of being infected with rabies, the person begins treatment with rabies vaccine.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

==Prevention== 
&lt;!--(if the section only discusses secondary prevention it should follow the treatment section)--&gt;
Cat bites can often be prevented by:
*instructing children not to tease pets.&lt;ref name=&quot;kidshealth.org&quot;&gt;https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/animal-bites-sheet.html?WT.ac=p-ra&lt;/ref&gt;
*being cautious with unfamiliar cats
*approaching cats with care, even if they appear to be friendly.
*avoiding rough play with cats and kittens.

Rough play causes is perceived as aggressive. This will lead to the cat being defensive when approached by people. Preventing cat bites includes not provoking the cat.

==Treatment==
The first step in treatment includes washing and then irrigating the bite wound.&lt;ref name=WHO2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal bites Fact sheet N°373|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=June 17, 2017|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/cats.html#what-to-do {{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Man2017/&gt; Often a tetanus shot is prescribed.&lt;ref name = kidshealth/&gt; If a cat that has bitten another cat or animal and appears to be ill, the cat would benefit from an assessment and possible treatment from a veterinarian. If there is a low risk that the wound has a low risk of being infected, it is sometimes only sutured.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; A person who has been bitten by a cat with rabies will need specialized treatment. Resulting infections from cat bites can be prevented by immediately. Washing wounds with soap and warm water is recommended.
Seek medical attention if: if the cat has not been vaccinated against rabies.&lt;ref name=&quot;kidshealth.org&quot;/&gt;
A tetanous booster is given to the person if It has been more than 5 years since their last tetanus shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/cats.html#what-to-do|title=Cats - Healthy Pets Healthy People - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=18 June 2017}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cat has bitten someone, and there is no evidence that the cat has been vaccinated against rabies, the person will be treated for rabies infection.&lt;ref name = &quot;auto&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Outcomes or Prognosis== --&gt;

==Epidemiology and special populations==
Over 400,000 cat bites occur each year though the actual number of bites is much higher since many such bites are under-reported.&lt;ref name = AAP&gt;{{cite web| publisher = American Academy of Pediatrics |  accessdate = June 17, 2017 | date = 2017 | title = Prevent Bite Wounds | url = https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Prevent-Bite-Wounds.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;  40 million households in the United States have pet cats.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/pets/index.html {{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on the number of people bitten or scratched by cats are limited because these incidents are not reported; however, 20%-80% of cat bites and scratches become infected.&lt;ref name=&quot;LloretEgberink2013&quot;/&gt; Cat-scratch disease or cat-scratch fever, an infection that causes fever and swollen lymph nodes, can develop from cat scratches even if they only break the surface of the skin. Based on reports of people treated for cat bites at hospitals, women are most likely to be victims of cat bites and scratches.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Because of their smaller build, children are more likely to be bitten on their head, neck and face. Adults are more likely to bitten on the hands and arms.&lt;ref name = Man2017/&gt; Those who are immunocompromised are more susceptible to infection from a cat bite.&lt;ref name = kidshealth/&gt;&lt;!--deaths due to cat bites: [[Cait Brennan]] --&gt;

'''[[Ovulation]]''' occurs at the [[ovary]] surface and is described as the process in which an [[oocyte]] (female germ cell) is released from the follicle. Ovulation is a non-deleterious 'inflammatory response' which is initiated by a [[Luteinizing hormone|Luteinising Hormone]] (LH) surge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=J. S.|last2=Hedin|first2=L.|date=1988|title=Molecular aspects of hormone action in ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and luteinization|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3288100|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|volume=50|pages=441–463|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.50.030188.002301|issn=0066-4278|pmid=3288100}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The mechanism of ovulation varies between species. In humans the ovulation process occurs around day 14 of the menstrual cycle, this can also be referred to as 'cyclical spontaneous ovulation'. However the monthly menstruation process is typically linked to humans and primates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strassmann|first=B. I.|date=June 1996|title=The evolution of endometrial cycles and menstruation|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8693059|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=181–220|issn=0033-5770|pmid=8693059}}&lt;/ref&gt;, all other animal species ovulate by various other mechanisms.

'''Spontaneous ovulation''' is the ovulatory process in which the maturing ovarian follicles secrete ovarian steroids to generate pulsatile [[GnRH]] (the neuropeptide which controls all vertebrate reproductive function) release into the median eminence (the area which connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary gland) to ultimately cause a pre-ovulatory LH surge. Spontaneously ovulating species go through [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycles]] and are fertile at certain times based on what part of the cycle they are in. Species in which the females are spontaneous ovulators include rats, mice, guinea pigs, sheep, monkeys, and women&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=J.|last2=Baum|first2=M. J.|date=July 2000|title=Neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH release in induced ovulators|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10882541|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=220–262|doi=10.1006/frne.2000.0198|issn=0091-3022|pmid=10882541}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Induced ovulation''' is the process in which the pre-ovulatory LH surge and therefore ovulation is induced by some component of coitus e.g receipt of genital stimulation. Usually spontaneous steroid-induced LH surges are not observed in induced ovulator species throughout their reproductive cycles, which indicates that GnRH release is absent or reduced due to lack of positive feedback action from steroid hormones. However, by contradiction some spontaneously ovulating species can occasionally undergo mating-induced preovulatory LH surges. Species in which the females are induced ovulators include cats, rabbits, ferrets, and camels&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;. In 1985, Chen et al., used Bactrian camels to investigate the factor(s) that induce ovulation during breeding season. They monitored the camel ovaries for ovulation by rectal palpation following insemination of semen samples. Chen et al., concluded that in this particular camel species ovulation was induced by the seminal plasma, and not by the spermatozoa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=B. X.|last2=Yuen|first2=Z. X.|last3=Pan|first3=G. W.|date=1985-07-01|title=Semen-induced ovulation in the bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/74/2/335|journal=Journal of Reproduction and Fertility|language=en|volume=74|issue=2|pages=335–339|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0740335|issn=1470-1626|pmid=3900379}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Evolution ==
Although the evolution of these two types of ovulation is not well understood, the type of ovulation that would be advantageous in some species can be understood by looking at social groups. Animals that have large, complex social groups benefit from spontaneous ovulation as only the best males get to breed with females. If there are little males suitable for breeding it makes sense to spread out the times at which females are fertile, therefore increasing the proportion in which conception occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conaway|first=C. H.|date=June 1971|title=Ecological adaptation and mammalian reproduction|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5000279|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=4|issue=3|pages=239–247|issn=0006-3363|pmid=5000279}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not explain the evolution of ovulation in all species however, for example some species appear to show estrus synchronisation.

== Mechanism ==
In spontaneous ovulators, [[estrogen]] secreted by the follicles as they grow and mature affects the release of GnRH, and therefore causes an LH surge.

Ovulation is triggered in induced ovulators by a LH surge from the anterior pituitary, which appears to be independent of GnRH release, and is induced during mating. Animals this has been recorded in include rabbits, voles, ferrets and camels.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In some species such as the ferret the duration of intromission has no effect on the LH surge, whereas in other species such as the cat these are related and higher levels of LH were produced by mating multiple times. In many species, for a LH surge to occur, little intromission is required.

The pathways in which information reaches the brain and causes GnRH release are not understood well, however midbrain and brainstem noradrenergic neurones appear to be activated in response to intromission during mating. These neurones then go on to stimulate the mediobasal hypothalamic to release GnRH from the median eminence. &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;Most experiments on GnRH and LH release have been focused on spontaneous ovulators, however there have been studies completed on some induced ovulators - rabbit and ferret. From this, it appears that norepinephrine facilitates GnRH release in the rabbit and ferret and the [[Locus coeruleus|locus coereuleus]] which is the part of the brain involved in conveying genital-somatosensory information to the GnRH neurones&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spies|first=H. G.|last2=Pau|first2=K. Y.|last3=Yang|first3=S. P.|date=February 1997|title=Coital and estrogen signals: a contrast in the preovulatory neuroendocrine networks of rabbits and rhesus monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9116126|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=56|issue=2|pages=310–319|issn=0006-3363|pmid=9116126}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other subsances that have similar effects include [[neuropeptide Y]].

== Species ==
Many species which have been found to be induced ovulators and the reasons for this are not always clear. However, one possible reason is that induced ovulation could provide a better reproductive potential for those species that typically have shorter life spans and less encounters resulting in lower mating opportunites throughout their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/openurl?sid=gale:&amp;aufirst=Jestina&amp;aulast=Katandukila&amp;atitle=Pattern%20of%20ovulation%20in%20the%20East%20African%20root%20rat%20(Tachyoryctes%20splendens)%20from%20Tanzania:%20induced%20or%20spontaneous%20ovulator?&amp;date=2016-05&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=00084301&amp;issue=5&amp;pages=345&amp;spage=345&amp;title=Canadian%20Journal%20of%20Zoology&amp;volume=94&amp;vid=44UOE_VU2&amp;institution=44UOE&amp;url_ctx_val=&amp;url_ctx_fmt=null&amp;isSerivcesPage=true|title=https://ed-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/openurl?sid=gale:&amp;aufirst=Jestina&amp;aulast=Katandukila&amp;atitle=Pattern%20of%20ovulation%20in%20the%20East%20African%20root%20rat%20(Tachyoryctes%20splendens)%20from%20Tanzania:%20induced%20or%20spontaneous%20ovulator?&amp;date=2016-05&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=00084301&amp;issue=5&amp;pages=345&amp;spage=345&amp;title=Canadian%20Journal%20of%20Zoology&amp;volume=94&amp;vid=44UOE_VU2&amp;institution=44UOE&amp;url_ctx_val=&amp;url_ctx_fmt=null&amp;isSerivcesPage=true|website=ed-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodents such as [[Ferret|ferrets]], [[Mouse|mice]] and [[Rat|rats]] are known induced ovulators. In Rats the East African Root Rat and the Cape-Dune, Natal, Highvield and Blind Mole Rats are known induced ovulators. These species require mating to stimulate the vagina and cervix, resulting in ovulation in the Females. The East African Root Rat has been found to have small spines on its penis which are also thought to contribute to this stimulation of induced ovulation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/openurl?sid=gale:&amp;aufirst=Jestina&amp;aulast=Katandukila&amp;atitle=Pattern%20of%20ovulation%20in%20the%20East%20African%20root%20rat%20(Tachyoryctes%20splendens)%20from%20Tanzania:%20induced%20or%20spontaneous%20ovulator?&amp;date=2016-05&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=00084301&amp;issue=5&amp;pages=345&amp;spage=345&amp;title=Canadian%20Journal%20of%20Zoology&amp;volume=94&amp;vid=44UOE_VU2&amp;institution=44UOE&amp;url_ctx_val=&amp;url_ctx_fmt=null&amp;isSerivcesPage=true|title=https://ed-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/openurl?sid=gale:&amp;aufirst=Jestina&amp;aulast=Katandukila&amp;atitle=Pattern%20of%20ovulation%20in%20the%20East%20African%20root%20rat%20(Tachyoryctes%20splendens)%20from%20Tanzania:%20induced%20or%20spontaneous%20ovulator?&amp;date=2016-05&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=00084301&amp;issue=5&amp;pages=345&amp;spage=345&amp;title=Canadian%20Journal%20of%20Zoology&amp;volume=94&amp;vid=44UOE_VU2&amp;institution=44UOE&amp;url_ctx_val=&amp;url_ctx_fmt=null&amp;isSerivcesPage=true|website=ed-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mice are also thought to be induced ovulators. Studies have found that the [[Luteinizing hormone|Lutenising Hormone]] (LH) is crucial to bring about the induced ovulation. Disruption in LH surges in the mice and knockout of the [[Progesterone]] receptor (progesterone is known to help maintain a pregnancy) results in lowered fertility of the mice. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Shannon B.

The [[Koala]] species are a lesser known induced ovulatory. The Koalas require mating in which the presence of ejaculated semen is needed to stimulate the female to produce a LH surge (which would cause ovulation of a follicle). Unlike many other animals, simply being in the presence of a male koala is not enough to induce ovulation itself, and nor is vaginal stimulation on its own sufficient to cause induced ovulation to occur. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=S.

The presence of koala semen in female koalas is known to be able to cause induced ovulation on its own, however only in just under 50% of the subjects tested but statistical [[Student's t-test|t tests]] confirmed this to be significant. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=S.

[[Cat|Cats]] are another widely known induced ovulator. After mating, the LH levels in female cats surge and the time to ovulation can be predicted to occur between 1-2 days later. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shille|first=V.

[[Goat|Goats]] too have been found to be induced ovulators. A 1984 study saw [[LHRH]] injections were able to cause ovulation in goats that were of sexual maturity and already in [[oestrus]]. These injections had no influence on goats that were not in oestrus and could be because there is reduced sensitivity to LH and FSH receptors in the non oestrus stages of the cycle so the LHRH may not have been able to induce a great enough response. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizinga|first=K.

[[Wolverine|Wolverines]] are other known induced ovulators which require physical mating to cause ovulation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mead|first=Rodney A.|last2=Bowles|first2=Mark|last3=Starypan|first3=Greg|last4=Jones|first4=Mike|date=1993-01-01|title=Evidence for pseudopregnancy and induced ovulation in captive wolverines (Gulo gulo)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.1430120405/abstract|journal=Zoo Biology|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=353–358|doi=10.1002/zoo.1430120405|issn=1098-2361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many bear species are able to have induced ovulation including the [[Grizzly bear]], Black [[Bear]] and the [[Polar bear]] where both the presence of a male and mating itself are requirements for induced ovulation. However, there are some suggestions that mating is not as strict a requirement for ovulation in bears. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Geng-Ruei|last2=Yang|first2=Chieh-Chung|last3=Hsu|first3=Son-Haur|last4=Lin|first4=Chang|last5=Chiu|first5=Chun-Lung|last6=Chan|first6=Fang-Tse|last7=Mao|first7=Frank Chiahung|title=Fecal Reproductive Steroid Profiles for Monitoring Reproductive Patterns in Female Formosan Black Bears (Ursus Thibetanus Formosanus)|url=http://www.bioone.org.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/doi/full/10.5735/086.048.0502|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=275–286|doi=10.5735/086.048.0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Bears are widely confirmed induced ovulators. It was observed that most females kept separate from males did not ovulate, where as females kept in areas with male bears did. Mating between the bears caused elevated progesterone levels and this was seen by increased progesterone levels measured in the bears in the months that followed the mating seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okano|first=Tsukasa|last2=Nakamura|first2=Sachiko|last3=Nakashita|first3=Rumiko|last4=Komatsu|first4=Takeshi|last5=Murase|first5=Tetsuma|last6=Asano|first6=Makoto|last7=Tsubota|first7=Toshio|date=2006|title=Incidence of Ovulation without Coital Stimuli in Captive Japanese Black Bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) based on Serum Progesterone Profiles|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/68/10/68_10_1133/_article/-char/ja/|journal=Journal of Veterinary Medical Science|volume=68|issue=10|pages=1133–1137|doi=10.1292/jvms.68.1133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In black bears the presence of a males was enough to cause a notable rise in progesterone levels even without mating but mating. This could suggest that [[Pheromone|pheromonal]]/[[chemosensory]] factors could also contribute to induced ovulation in some species.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Induced ovulation is able to occur in some fish species. In china freshwater fish including a variety of [[carp]] types, [[bream]] and loach are able to be induced to ovulate by using agonists of [[dopamine]]. This induction of ovulation from drugs is able to cause a predictable ovulation period and is very beneficial to farming of these species. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Richard E.|last2=Lin|first2=Hao-Ren|last3=Van Der Kraak|first3=Glen|date=1988-11-01|title=Induced ovulation and spawning of cultured freshwater fish in China: Advances in application of GnRH analogues and dopamine antagonists|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0044848688900804|journal=Aquaculture|series=Induced Spawning of Asian Fishes|volume=74|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/0044-8486(88)90080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In cattle ==
The natural cycle of spontaneous ovulation occurs in species such as [[Cattle|cows]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogle|first=O. A.|last2=Ratto|first2=M. H.|last3=Adams|first3=G.

There are a number of methods that are used to induce ovulation in cattle such as: artificial insemination, introducing a number of hormones such as chorionic gonadotrophin,  hCG and LH. As well as injecting progesterone by intravaginal devices called PRIDs (progesterone-releasing intravaginal devices) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yavas|first=Y.|last2=Wallon|first2=J.S.|date=2000-07-01|title=Induction of ovulation in postpartum suckled beef cows: A review|url=http://www.theriojournal.com/article/S0093-691X(00)00322-8/pdf|journal=Theriogenology|language=English|volume=54|issue=1|doi=10.1016/S0093-691X(00)00322-8|issn=0093-691X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==In cats==
Domestic [[cat]]s are often described as induced ovulators. During intromission, the penis probably causes distension of the posterior vagina and induces release of [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] (GnRH) from the [[hypothalamus]] via neuroendocrine reflexes. A surge of [[Luteinizing hormone|luteinising hormone]] (LH) occurs within minutes of mating. With multiple matings, the LH surge is greater and lasts longer than when only one mating occurs.  There are reports of ovulation without mating in cats. Spontaneous ovulation not only occurs in cats, but occurs with some frequency. It appears that non-copulatory ovulation may be possible in response to a variety of visual, auditory or olfactory cues. It is more appropriate to consider domestic cats to be both an induced and spontaneous ovulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estrus|url=http://vetbook.org/wiki/cat/index.php/Estrus|year=2012|publisher=The University of Sydney|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rabbits==
It has been known since 1905&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heape, W.|year=1905|title=Ovulation and degeneration of ova in the rabbit.|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|volume=76|pages=260–268|doi=10.1098/rspb.1905.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; that domestic [[rabbit]]s are physically induced ovulators, although they may also ovulate spontaneously.  Early reports stated that simply having an oestrous doe in close proximity to a buck can induce ovulation, although there were no data presented in these early reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staples, R.E.|journal=J. Reprod. Fert.|title=Behavioural induction of ovulation in the oestrous rabbit.|year=1967|volume=13|pages=429–435|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0130429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In camelids==
[[Dromedary]] camels (''Camelus dromedarius''), [[bactrian camel]]s (''Camelus bactrianus''), [[llama]]s (''Lama glama'') and [[alpaca]]s (''Lama pacos'') are all induced ovulators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bravo, P.

===Bactrian camel===
Bactrian camels ovulate after insemination of semen into the vagina; it is the seminal plasma, but not the spermatozoa, which induces ovulation.  Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 h and the rest by 48 h (the same as natural mating). The least amount of semen required to elicit ovulation is about 1.0 ml.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Reprod.

===Alpaca===
In alpaca, follicles ovulate approximately 26 h after coital stimulation. Mounting accompanied by intromission is necessary to provide adequate stimulation for LH release and subsequent ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fernandez-Baca, S., Madden, D.H.L. and Novoa, C.|year=1970|title=Effect of different mating stimuli on induction of ovulation in the alpaca.|journal=J.

Prolonged copulation, causing abrasion and inflammation of the uterus, may enhance absorption of OIF.

== Pseudopregnancy in Cats ==
[[File:BEN Bengalian kitten (4492540155).jpg|alt=Kitten|thumb|[[Kitten|'''Kitten''']]]]
Domestic cats are a species that can become pseudopregnant. This occurs when a female cat ovulates but is not fertilised due to breeding with an infertile male, spontaneous ovulation or due to the owner stimulating ovulation. In pseudo pregnancy in cats the corpus luteum is present after ovulation and persists for around 37 days. The length of pseudopregnancy varies in cats greatly with the mean duration being 41 days. After pseudopregnancy, the female cat returns to proestrus and can become pregnant again. The pseudo-pregnancy lasts around half the length of a normal pregnancy in cats which does not occur in all other species such as dogs. This is advantageous to the cats as they can conceive earlier making them more efficient in reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersen|first1=Amanda|date=2015|title=Reproductive physiology of the female cat|url=http://stud.epsilon.slu.se/7921/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
In cats, the progesterone and estradiol profiles in pseudo-pregnancy are very different when compared to normal pregnancy. During Pseudopregnancy estradiol increased straight after mating and then decreased returning to normal levels. The amount of progesterone did not increase until 2-3 days post copulation, then the level rises until day 21 post copulation where after it gradually declined returning to normal levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersen|first1=Amanda|title=Reproductive physiology of the female cat|date=2015|url=http://stud.epsilon.slu.se/7921/}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Pseudopregnancy in Dogs ==

Pseudo-pregnancy is a normal physiologic process that occurs in female dogs. It is seen 45-60 days after a normal estrous (heat) period. After ovulation, progesterone levels rise. Pseudo-pregnancy happens when the progesterone levels begin to fall as decreasing progesterone leads to an increase of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is responsible for the behaviours seen during pseudo-pregnancy. Dogs may exhibit mothering of toys, nesting or aggression. Mammary development and milk production are common. Pseudopregnancy can also be acutely induced by spaying (removing of ovaries) a dog near the end of estrus. Spaying removes the source of progesterone and induces a rise in prolactin.

Permanent prevention of pseudopregnancy is accomplished with spaying&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vmth/local_resources/pdfs/repro_pdfs/cepseudopregnancy.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Pseudopregnancy in Swine ==
[[File:Sow and five piglets.jpg|alt=Pig with piglets|thumb|'''[[Pig]] with [[Piglet (animal)|piglets]]''']]
Pseudopregnancy or &quot;Not-in-Pig&quot; is a condition that occurs when female exhibit physiological and behavioral signs associated with pregnancy, but there are no fetuses present. Pseudopregnancy can occur when all of the embryos are resorbed after the maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 10-15 postmating) and before fetal calcification (days 35-40 of gestation). The sow remains anestrus for prolonged periods, often as long as 115 days. These animals may exhibit varying degrees of udder development, but fail to deliver any pigs. The timely identification and removal of non-pregnant females from the breeding herd is important because it reduces both non-productive sow days and production costs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/swine_extension/swinereports/2001/02physflow.htm|title=Real-time Ultrasonography and diagnosis of pseudopregnancy in swine|website=projects.ncsu.edu|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Techniques used for pregnancy diagnosis in swine include ultrasonography, amplitude depth machines, and Doppler machines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.pork.org/filelibrary/factsheets/pigfactsheets/newfactsheets/08-04-03g.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Neuroendocrine Pathway of Pseudopregnancy in Rats ==
The initiation of pseudopregnancy is basically similar to the pregnancy regarding the activation of progestational state. The neuroendocrine pathway of pseudopregnancy in rats is mainly initiated by the nocturnal surge of prolactin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terkel|first=J.|date=1988|title=Neuroendocrine processes in the establishment of pregnancy and pseudopregnancy in rats|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3287417|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=13|issue=1-2|pages=5–28|issn=0306-4530|pmid=3287417}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The hormone prolactin produced regulates the activation and early maintenance of corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is known as a site of progesterone production in order for the uterus undergoes a decidual process. There are two types of induced pseudopregnancy; coitally induced pseudopregnancy and non-coitally induced pseudopregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terkel|first=J.|date=1986|title=Neuroendocrinology of coitally and noncoitally induced pseudopregnancy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3555247|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=474|pages=76–94|issn=0077-8923|pmid=3555247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coitally induced pseudopregnancy is stimulated by the action of copulation. The copulation stimulation causes the nocturnal prolactin elevation which then activates the corpus luteum. The multiple intromission coital pattern initiates the neuroendocrine reflex which results in the sufficient progesterone secretion in pseudopregnancy. However, induction of pseudopregnancy requires adrenergic system to be activated and simultaneously inhibits the cholinergic system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terkel|first=J.|date=1986|title=Neuroendocrinology of coitally and noncoitally induced pseudopregnancy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3555247|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=474|pages=76–94|issn=0077-8923|pmid=3555247}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

The non-coitally induced pseudopregnancy requires the presence of the initial stimulus until the levels of progesterone are sufficiently elevated to produce positive feedback on secretion of prolactin. The initial stimulus can be in a form of some socio-environmental factors, such as concaveation with foster pups in virgin rats or cohabitation in all-female groups in mice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terkel|first=J.|date=1986|title=Neuroendocrinology of coitally and noncoitally induced pseudopregnancy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3555247|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=474|pages=76–94|issn=0077-8923|pmid=3555247}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
